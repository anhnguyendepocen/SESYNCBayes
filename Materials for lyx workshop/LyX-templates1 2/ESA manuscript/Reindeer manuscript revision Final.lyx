 biological diversity recognize the importance of sustaining traditional
 human livelihoods, particularly uses of the land that are compatible with
 intact landscapes and ecologically complete food webs.
 However, these efforts often confront conflicting goals.
 For example, conserving native predators may harm pastoralist economies
 because predators consume domestic livestock that sustain people.
 This potential conflict must be reconciled by policy, but such reconciliation
 requires a firm understanding of the effects of predators on the prey used
 by people.
 We used a long-term, large-scale database and Bayesian models to estimate
 the impacts of lynx (
\emph on
Lynx lynx
\emph default
), wolverine (
\emph on
Gulo gulo
\emph default
), and brown bear (
\emph on
Ursus arctos
\emph default
) on harvest of semi-domesticated reindeer (
\emph on
Rangifer tarandus
\emph default
) by Sámi pastoralists in Sweden.
 The average annual harvest of reindeer averaged 25% of the population (95%
 credible interval = 19, 31).
 Annual harvest declined by 96.6 (31, 155) reindeer for each lynx family
 group (the surveyed segment of the lynx population) in a management unit
 and by 94.3 (20, 160) for each wolverine reproduction (the surveyed segment
 of the wolverine population).
 We failed to detect effects of predation by brown bear.
 The mechanism for effects of predation on harvest was reduced population
 growth rate.
 The rate of increase of reindeer populations declined with increasing abundance
 of lynx and wolverine.
 The density of reindeer, latitude, and weather indexed by the North Atlantic
 Oscillation also influenced reindeer population growth rate.
 We conclude that there is a biological basis for compensating the Sámi
 reindeer herders for predation on reindeer.

Introduction 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many areas of the world, efforts to conserve biological diversity have
 shifted from a historic emphasis on protecting single species to approaches
 that emphasize maintaining intact landscapes and fully functioning food
 webs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Grumbine:1994jw,Liddicker:1995kn,Boyd:2008uq"

\end_inset

.
 Because indigenous human consumers have been a part of these food webs
 for millennia, sustaining the livelihoods of indigenous people alongside
 the biota has emerged as an important conservation goal.
 Often, traditional uses of land by people assure the landscape is maintained
 in a state that is far more hospitable to biological diversity than would
 be the case if these traditional economies were replaced by more intensive
 uses of the land.
 However, landscape-level conservation is demanding because it often creates
 conflicting goals that must somehow be reconciled.
 For example, restoration and conservation of large mammals, particularly
 large predators, is a laudable conservation objective, but it has the potential
 to harm human livelihoods that may be vital to sustaining semi-wild landscapes
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Thirgood:2005ij"

\end_inset

.
 This problem is particularly acute for lands inhabited by people whose
 well-being depends on harvesting prey species that are also consumed by
 predators.
 When conflicts between predators and people occur, they must be remedied
 by management.
 However, this management can be costly and must be justified on the basis
 of understanding impacts of predators on prey shared with human users of
 the land

 Reindeer husbandry is central to their culture and livelihood.
 During the last two millennia, domesticated reindeer have been used for
 meat, hides, transportation, milking, and to lure wild reindeer to sites
 for capture.
 Today, Sámi pastoralists allow their reindeer herds to migrate across large
 distances unimpeded by fences, gathering them only a few times a year

\begin_layout Standard
The area of land devoted to reindeer husbandry covers approximately half
 of the area of Sweden and offers vital habitat for the Eurasian lynx (
\emph on
Lynx lynx
\emph default
), wolverine (
\emph on
Gulo gulo
\emph default
), and brown bear (
\emph on
Ursus arctos
\emph default
).
 The main prey for lynx and wolverine is now the semi-domestic reindeer,
 and reindeer husbandry is believed to suffer, at least locally, from the
 effects of this predation.
 As a consequence, policy makers in Fennoscandia face a problem of compromising
 between competing management goals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Policy on management of large predators in Sweden and Norway is guided by
 international agreements that simultaneously require sustaining the livelihood
 of the Sámi people as well as assuring the viability of populations of
 large carnivores 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nilsson-Dahlstrom:2003ai"

\end_inset

.
 In Sweden, the national government compensates reindeer herders for assumed
 damage caused by predators.
 The yearly cost of compensation for all predators together was 60 MSEK
 (about 6 M€ or about 8.6 M$) in 2008 (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency,
 unpublished), 29 MSEK (about 2.9 M€ or about 4.1 M$) of which was paid to
 offset effects of lynx predation and 20 MSEK (about 2.0 M€ or about 2.9 M$)
 was compensation for predation by wolverine.
 The Swedish scheme for compensation is based risk of economic loss by herders
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Schwerdtner:2007kx"

\end_inset

, and risk, in turn, is estimated from the number of predators present within
 a reindeer-grazing district.
 In 2008 the compensation was 200,000 SEK (about 20,000 € or about 29,000
 $) for each lynx family group found within a reindeer-grazing district
 (i.e., an adult female with her kittens of the year; the surveyed segment
 of the population) and the same amount for each wolverine reproduction
 (the surveyed segment of the population).
 Under this compensation scheme, the reindeer owners accept some losses
 to predators and, in return, the Swedish government attempts to give full
 compensation for the financial losses due to reduced slaughter and other
 costs caused by the predators, for example, increased herding costs caused
 by disturbance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No assessment has been done whether this system is “fair”.
 The system is based on assuming a one-to-one relationship between losses
 to predators and number of predators; thus, doubling the number of predators
 should double the losses of reindeer.
 However, current rates of compensation of the number of reindeer that fall
 prey to predators described above are based on rough estimates of consumption
 rates and conservation values 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Naturva"

\end_inset

.
 These estimates are not derived from any comprehensive, large scale analysis
 of effects of predators on reindeer population dynamics or harvest.
 Consequently, expenditures for compensation are difficult to justify politicall
y.
 Thus, there is a pressing need to understand effects of predators on reindeer
 to support decisions on compensation for losses to predators.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reindeer husbandry system also provides an unusual opportunity to gain
 basic insight into population dynamics of large herbivores.
 Unlike domesticated livestock, reindeer are free ranging and as a result,
 are fully exposed to effects of predators and weather.
 Annual gathers of animals by herders assure that populations are censused
 repeatedly under similar conditions.
 As described in more detail below (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Materials"

\end_inset

), records from the reindeer husbandry system offer a time series of population
 observations replicated extensively along a latitudinal gradient.
 This time series creates an opportunity to address a fundamental question
 in population ecology: “How does the growth of populations of large herbivores
 respond to the environmental context, to external forcing from predation
 and weather, and to internal forcing from density dependence?” This question
 has engaged researchers all over the world

\end_inset

.
 However, most previous studies have gained insight by observing temporal
 variation in populations at a single location; research in population ecology
 that simultaneously analyzes variation in space and time is less common
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Post:2005rq,Wang:2006qc,Melis:2009mb,Wang:2009jo"

 Moreover, work that has considered spatio-temporal variation has been done
 at coarse spatial scales; fine scale variation has not been widely considered.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we report an analysis of the effects of predation by lynx, wolverine,
 and brown bear on reindeer harvest and population growth rate in Sweden.
 Our work focused on two objectives: to determine if predators have a measurable
, long-term impact on reindeer harvest and to evaluate the magnitude of
 the effects of predators on reindeer population growth relative to other
 sources of variation including density dependence, latitudinal gradients
 in climate and resources, and annual variation in weather.
 The approach we offer provides a broadly applicable model for decision
 support needed to achieve compromises between goals for conservation of
 traditional livelihoods and goals for conservation of large, native predators.

Semi-domestic reindeer are part of a pastoral production system where reindeer
 are herded by indigenous Sámi people.
 The reindeer husbandry area is divided into 51 reindeer management units,
 most of which (n=33) are defined by river valleys extending northwest -
 southeast.
 In these areas, animals are herded along rivers between winter ranges in
 the forest (southeast) and summer ranges in the mountains (northwest),
 areas that are 100 to 300 km apart 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bjarvall:1990eu"

\end_inset

.
 The remaining management units (n=18) are primarily forested.
 In these areas, herds do not migrate.
 The total number of reindeer after harvest in December has been between
 220,000-260,000 and yearly harvest between 47,000-74,000 during the last
 10 years (official data from Swedish Board of Agriculture and Sámi Parliament).

\begin_layout Standard
Several large predators prey upon semi-domesticated reindeer.
 Eurasian lynx and wolverine are believed to have the greatest impacts on
 reindeer production.
 During 2008, lynx accounted for 48% of the compensation paid to pastoralists,
 while wolverine accounted for 33% (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency
 and Sámi Parliament).
 Based on surveys of lynx family groups and wolverine reproductions (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 reindeer husbandry area during the last 10 years was 500-900 lynx

 and 310-650 wolverine

\begin_layout Standard
We analyzed observations of reindeer population size, reindeer harvest,
 and results of predator surveys from 51 reindeer management units in Sweden
 during 1996 – 2008 (Swedish Board of Agriculture and Sámi Parliament, unpublish
ed).
 The number of reindeer harvested in each management unit and the post-harvest
 population size are recorded during September – December each year when
 reindeer populations are gathered by herders for slaughter.
 The reindeer data in our analysis are based on these annual records of
 herd numbers, composition, and harvest as reported by reindeer owners.
 We used official survey data on lynx and wolverine from the Swedish Environment
al Protection Agency and County Administration Boards from 1996 to 2009.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
County administration boards have monitored lynx and wolverines within the
 reindeer husbandry area since 1996.
 The aim of the survey is to find all lynx family groups and wolverine reproduct
ions within the reindeer husbandry area each year.
 Therefore, the county administration boards organize the surveys mainly
 through field personnel, but a network of reindeer herders within the 51
 management units also contribute.
 As the compensation system is based on these surveys, there is a very strong
 incentive for reindeer herders to report tracks of lynx family groups and
 wolverine den sites to the county administration boards.
 These reports are verified by field personnel from the county administration
 boards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lynx survey is performed during January and February by snow-tracking
 and identifying family groups consisting of adult females with kittens
 approximately nine months old.
 Tracks in the snow from two or more lynx traveling together during January
 and February almost always indicate presence of a family group.
 Criteria based on observed home range sizes and movement rates (Linnell
 et al., 2007) are used to assure that counts of family groups are distinct.
 These surveys provide an index of all lynx in the district.
 On average, one lynx family group represents 6.1 (±0.44) lynx in an area
 (Andrén et al., 2002).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wolverine survey is performed from March to May and is based on documentatio
n of den sites or tracks of females with cubs of the year after den abandonment
 (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, unpublished).
 The number of wolverine reproductions in a reindeer-grazing district is
 assumed to be proportionate to the total population size; on average, there
 are 6.4 (±0.8) wolverines in the population for each reproduction

).
 During the first week of the moose hunt in September and October, moose
 hunters record all observation of brown bear, generating an index (observations
 per 1000 h) covering almost all of Sweden.
 The bear observation index is based on about 2.5 million observation hours

Harvest model 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We conducted two analyses to meet two distinct objectives.
 Our first objective was to estimate long-term effects of predators on the
 average harvest of reindeer in Sweden.
 To meet this objective, we analyzed the 13-year averages of the number
 of reindeer harvested in relation to 13 year averages in predator abundance
 across 51 reindeer management units.
 We used the simple Bayesian model,
\change_inserted -1308405981 1370939602
 
\change_unchanged

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mu_{i} & = & b_{0}+b_{1}R_{i}+b_{2}L_{i}+b_{3}W_{i}+b_{4}B_{i}+b_{5}G_{i}\\
\Pr\left({{\bf {b}},\sigma|{\bf {h}}}\right) & \propto & \prod\limits _{i=1}^{51}{{\rm {lognormal}}\left[{\bar{h}_{i}\mid\log\left({\mu_{i}}\right),\sigma}\right]}\times\\

\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is the vector of regression coefficients, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is the standard deviation of the estimate on the log scale, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}$
\end_inset

 is a 51 element vector of mean harvest, averaged over 13 years.
 The subscript 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset


\emph default
 indexes reindeer management units (
\emph on
i
\emph default
=1...51).
 Thus, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{h_{i}}$
\end_inset

 is the 13 year mean harvest for management unit 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, excluding rare missing values, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the model prediction of the median of the distribution of the average
 harvest.
 Independent variables are 13 year means for the total number of reindeer
 (
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}$
\end_inset

), the number of lynx family groups (
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}$
\end_inset

), the number of wolverine reproductions (
\begin_inset Formula $W_{i}$
\end_inset

), and the bear index (
\begin_inset Formula $B_{i}$
\end_inset

).
 The predictor 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the latitude at the centroid of the management unit (converted to a
 continuous number of kilometers from Swedish National Grid; RT90).
 We included a north - south gradient as an explanatory variable to account
 for latitudinal differences in climate and primary production 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "LundqvistHetal"

\end_inset

.
 This gradient was centered on 0 by subtracting the mean latitude from all
 observations.
 We used a lognormal likelihood function for the probability of the data
 conditional on the model parameters because the observations of harvest
 were lognormally distributed (Fig.
  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Histograms"

\end_inset

).
 Priors were chosen to be uninformative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We analyzed the model (Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:rharvest model"

\end_inset

) in three ways: 1) with untransformed data, 2) with predator abundance
 indices converted to density indices by dividing the abundance indices
 by the area of year-round pasture in each management unit, and 3) with
 standardized independent variables.
 We chose the area of year-round pastures as a basis for estimating density
 indices because winter pastures are not used every year.
 The year-round pastures were on average 45 % (± 4 % S.E.) of the total area
 of the reindeer management units, and the two measurements were also correlated
 (n = 51, r = 0.32, p = 0.02).
 Independent variables were standardized by subtracting their means and
 dividing by their standard deviations to allow comparison of the magnitude
 of the effects of regression coefficients

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The regression coefficients in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:regression_determin"

\end_inset

 are interpreted as follows.
 Because the north-south gradient was centered on 0, the intercept is the
 offset in production that occurs at the average latitude of the management
 areas.
 The coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1}$
\end_inset

 is the number of reindeer harvested per reindeer.
 The predation coefficients (
\begin_inset Formula $b_{2},b_{3},b_{4}$
\end_inset

) give the change in average reindeer harvest per unit change in predator
 abundance, and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{4}$
\end_inset

 gives the change in reindeer harvest per km of latitude along the north-south
 gradient.
 When coefficients were standardized, they represent the change in harvest
 per one standard deviation change in an independent variable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Population model 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our second objective was to evaluate the effects of predation on reindeer
 population growth relative to effects of density, weather, and latitude.
 To meet this objective, we portrayed reindeer population growth for each
 management area using a Bayesian, state-space model: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}

Posterior predictive checks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most basic approach to checking the fit of a model is to compare replicated
 datasets simulated from the model to the data that were used to estimate
 the model’s parameters 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Gelman:2004wm,Gelman:2009fu"

\end_inset

.
 The failure of the distribution of simulated data to mimic the distribution
 of the real data is diagnostic of structural deficiencies in the deterministic
 core of the model and/or problems in the choices of probability distributions
 used to represent stochasticity.
 To evaluate model fit, we used posterior predictive checks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Gelman:2004wm,Gelman:2009fu"

\end_inset

.
 Posterior predictive checks use a test statistic calculated from the observed
 data 
\begin_inset Formula $(T^{obs}$
\end_inset

) and from replicated datasets simulated from the posterior predictive distribut
ion 
\begin_inset Formula $(T^{rep})$
\end_inset

.
 To test for lack of fit, we calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{B}$
\end_inset

, defined as the probability that the simulated data are more extreme than
 the observed data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Gelman:2004wm"

\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{B}=\Pr\left[T^{rep}(y^{rep},\theta)\ge T^{obs}(y,\theta)|y\right],\label{eq: Bayesian P}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is the vector of the parameters in the model.
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: Bayesian P"

\end_inset

 is a two tailed probability, which means a model shows lack of fit if 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{B}$
\end_inset

 is close to 0 or 1 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Gelman:2004wm"

\end_inset

.
 For the harvest model, we used the test statistics:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T^{obs}=\sum_{i=1}^{51}\frac{\left(\bar{h}_{i}-\mu_{i}\right)^{2}}{\mu_{i}},\; T^{rep}=\sum_{i=1}^{51}\frac{\left(\bar{h}_{i}^{rep}-\mu_{i}\right)^{2}}{\mu_{i}},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the 51 element vector

\end_inset

 is drawn from the posterior predictive distribution and other parameters
 are as defined above (Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 For the population model, we used 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T^{obs}=\sum_{i=1}^{41}\sum_{t=1}^{13}\frac{\left(y_{i,t}-N_{i,t}\right)^{2}}{N_{i,t}},\; T^{rep}=\sum_{i=1}^{41}\sum_{t=1}^{13}\frac{\left(y_{i,t}^{rep}-N_{i,t}\right)^{2}}{N_{i,t}}.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Consequences of observation uncertainty in predator indices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data were not available to asses sampling error or bias in estimates of
 indices of predator abundance.
 However, we can be sure that there is some uncertainty in the predator
 predictor variables.
 To assess the consequences of this uncertainty, we conducted simulations
 for all predator coefficients for which the upper 95% credible interval
 was < 0.
 We assumed observation standard deviations 
\begin_inset Formula $(\sigma_{obs})$
\end_inset

 equaled the index value 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{obs})$
\end_inset

 multiplied by coefficients of variation ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 and that
 the true value of the predictor 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{true})$
\end_inset

 was distributed as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x_{true}\sim\textnormal{gamma}\mbox{\ensuremath{\left(\frac{x_{obs}^{2}}{\sigma_{obs}^{2}},\frac{x_{obs}}{\sigma_{obs}^{2}}\right).}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For each coefficient of variation and corresponding value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{obs}$
\end_inset

, we estimated the probability that the the predation coefficient value
 was less than zero using the empirical cumulative distribution of the converged
 MCMC chains.
 This allowed us to examine if conclusions on predator effects were robust
 to assumptions on observation uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Why we avoided model selection 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We chose to avoid model selection in our analysis for philosophical and
 operational reasons.
 Our choice was motivated philosophically by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Gelman:1995kb"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Clark:2007bd"

, and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Knape:2011jl"

\end_inset

 who argued that under many circumstances, objectives for insight from the
 model, rather than the use of model selection statistics, should guide
 the choice of model structure.
 We can reasonably decide 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 to include a parameter in a model if there is a firmly established biological
 mechanism that stands behind the operation of the parameter and if the
 objective of the modeling is to estimate the parameter’s value and to evaluate
 its importance relative to other mechanistic parameters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our choice was motivated operationally by the subjectivity that is required
 by current methods for estimating model weights.
 There is substantial ambiguity in the statistical literature on how to
 select best models from a set of candidates 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Different approaches to multi-model inference can lead to dramatically
 different conclusions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Link:2006gb,Link:2010qq"

\end_inset

 Moreover, all current methods are sensitive to the choice of the assumed
 prior distribution of model weights and to the choice of shape parameters
 in vague priors

 Widely used information-theoretic methods do not solve the problem of model
 over-fitting when many covariates are considered 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Knape:2011jl"

\end_inset

.
 Rather than choosing subjectively among model selection methods and priors
 on model weights, we chose to use full but relatively simple models with
 well established, biological foundations.

\series bold
 
\series default
We chose to examine main effects alone, without considering interactions.
 Adding interactions among predictors would dramatically expand the number
 of parameters to be estimated.
 Our choice to use a single model for inference means that the inferences
 we offer are conditional on the model we analyzed.

 Estimates of regression coefficients representing the change in harvest

 This corresponds to an annual reduction in harvest by about 15 reindeer

\begin_layout Standard
Comparisons of standardized regression coefficients (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Param_est_harvest_model"

\end_inset

) showed that variation in reindeer population size had the greatest impact
 on reindeer harvest among the variables studied and that variation in latitude
 had roughly half the effect of variation in reindeer numbers.
 Increases in lynx abundance exerted effects on growth rate that were about
 1/3 of the effect of reindeer population size, and the effect of variation
 in wolverine abundance was about half as large as the effect of lynx.
 Effects of brown bear were minor relative to the other predators.

 (95% CI = -.023, -068).
 We observed similar effects of predators on reindeer population growth
 when predator abundance was expressed as density rather than number per
 management unit (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Est_param_state_space"

\end_inset

).
 Comparisons of regression coefficients for standardized data showed that
 the effect of latitude was roughly four to five times stronger than individual
 effects of predation, density, or NAO and that individual effects of predators,
 density dependence, and the NAO were similar.

 The independent variables for predators in the abundance model are unadjusted
 indices of numbers of predators in a reindeer management unit; the density
 model uses abundance indices per 100 km
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$

 of year-round pastures, and the standardized models uses standardized indices
 of numbers of predators in a reindeer management unit [i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x_{i}-\mu\right)/\sigma$

 Reindeer number is the annual count of reindeer in a management unit.

Simulations of observation uncertainty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A central finding was that predation by lynx and wolverine reduced reindeer
 harvest and population growth rate.
 However, this conclusion depends on the unrealistic assumption that indices
 of predator abundance reflect the true abundance without uncertainty.
 Simulations revealed that our overall conclusion on predator effects was
 robust to unbiased observation uncertainty that might arise, for example,
 from sampling error (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Observation_error"

\end_inset

).
 Even when assumed coefficients of variation for predator indices approached
 1, there was substantial weight of evidence in the posterior distribution
 of coefficients supporting the conclusion that predators reduce harvest
 and retard population growth (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Observation_error"

\end_inset

).

 The x-axis is the assumed coefficient of variation in predator indices
 resulting from observation uncertainty.
 The y-axis is the proportion of estimates in the MCMC chain for which the
 estimate of the the predation coefficient (

Predation effects on long-term harvest 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using a large-scale database and Bayesian regression, we demonstrated a
 depressing effect of predators on reindeer harvest and population growth
 rate in Sweden.
 Analysis revealed that average annual harvest per management unit was reduced
 by 97 reindeer per surveyed lynx family group.
 This reduction in harvest is somewhat lower than what would be expected
 based on kill rate by lynx based on radio telemetry studies, assuming that
 predation is largely additive 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Mattisson:2011fk"

\end_inset

.
 In our analysis, we used lynx family groups as an index of the total number
 of lynx in a management area.
 On average a lynx family group during the winter survey also represents
 the presence of males and single females (Andrén et al., 2002).
 Furthermore, lynx kill rate on reindeer varies due to seasonal variation
 in reindeer density and density of alternative prey 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Sunde:2000uq,Mattisson:2011fk"

\end_inset

.
 Thus, there were factors influencing kill rate that were not possible to
 take into account in our large-scale study.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a mean abundance of lynx family groups per management area (= 2.53)
 and mean population size of reindeer (= 4701), we estimate that herders
 at the average latitude could harvest 247 fewer reindeer as a consequence
 of lynx predation alone or 82% of what could be harvested if there were
 no lynx.
 However, estimates based on averages may offer an overly optimistic view
 of effects of predation on reindeer production because distributions of
 the number of reindeer in a management unit and the number of lynx family
 groups are highly skewed (Fig.
 1).
 The data and model imply the greatest impacts of lynx predation on reindeer
 harvest when lynx abundance is high and when the population size of reindeer
 is low.
 In these cases, our analyses show that the reduction in harvest resulting
 from lynx predation can be disproportionately greater than would be predicted
 from average lynx and reindeer abundance (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figHarvest_change_from_predation"

\end_inset

).
 Assuming average lynx numbers and below-average reindeer numbers, harvest
 in the presence of lynx could reasonably be expected to range between 50-80%
 of harvest from predator free herds (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figHarvest_change_from_predation"

\end_inset

).
 However, if lynx abundance is above average (i.e., at the 75% quantile of
 the data = 3.87
\series bold
 
\series default
surveyed
\series bold
 
\series default
lynx family groups per management unit), then harvest from reindeer management
 units with less than the average herd size are expected to fall between
 20-70% of the predator-free harvest (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figHarvest_change_from_predation"

\end_inset

).
 These results show that levels of lynx abundance well within the range
 of the observed data could cause dramatic reductions in harvest from reindeer
 populations and that the magnitude of these reductions is amplified when
 reindeer populations are small.
 We caution, however, that the credible intervals on all of these estimates
 are broad (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figHarvest_change_from_predation"

\end_inset

).
 Hence, we cannot rule out effects of predation on harvest that could be
 substantially smaller or substantially greater than the mean estimates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kill rates of reindeer by wolverine have not been estimated directly from
 field data.
 However, using radio telemetry observations, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Mattisson:kl"

\end_inset

 estimated that kill rates of reindeer by lynx were much higher than kill
 rates of reindeer by wolverine, a finding at odds with our result that
 the average number of reindeer killed per surveyed lynx family group is
 approximately the same as the number killed per surveyed wolverine reproduction.
 The wolverine kill rate was from an area where lynx and wolverine coexist.
 Wolverines frequently scavenge reindeer killed by lynx 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Mattisson:kl"

\end_inset

, so the expected kill rate of reindeer by wolverines is higher in areas
 without lynx 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Andren_2011"

\end_inset

.
 Moreover, the 97.5% quantile of the posterior distribution of the ratio
 of lynx / wolverine kill rates was 4.42, which is more in line with the
 field estimate.
 We observed the same non-linearities in effects of wolverine on reductions
 in reindeer harvest as we observed for lynx (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figHarvest_change_from_predation"

\end_inset

).
 Again, effects of predation were disproportionately great when wolverine
 abundance was above average and reindeer population size was below average.

Model predictions of the proportional change in harvest attributable to
 lynx and wolverine predation as a function of reindeer population size.
 Two levels of predator abundance were used in predictions, the mean level
 and the upper 75% quantile.
 Dashed lines give 95% credible intervals on model predictions.
 The vertical dotted line indicates the mean reindeer population size.

\begin_layout Standard
Results from the state-space model reinforced the conclusions of the regression
 model and provided a mechanistic explanation for diminished harvest in
 management units where lynx and wolverine were abundant.
 Parameter estimates from the state space model suggest that predators caused
 meaningful reductions in the annual increment in reindeer population size,
 which in turn, reduced the harvestable surplus.
 It is possible that our findings of effects of predators on population
 growth and harvest depend on our implicit assumption that predation does
 not compensate for other sources of mortality that might result, for example,
 from density dependent feedbacks.
 If predation partially substitutes for density-dependent mortality, then
 effects predation may be overestimated.
 However, we reduced this possibility by including a separate term for density
 dependence in the population model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Realized rates of increase in reindeer populations were shaped by a composite
 of forces, including density dependence, predation, weather, and latitude.
 Standardized regression coefficients revealed roughly equivalent effects
 of predation, density, and winter weather (indexed by the NAO).
 Changes in latitude exerted effects that were four to five times as great
 as predation, density or weather.
 We suggest that the particularly strong effects of latitude resulted in
 part from increasing weather severity and diminished primary productivity
 at northern latitudes.
 However, there also may be an effect of differences in husbandry.
 Management units at the southern end of the gradient tended to have larger
 proportions of adult females in the population (linear regression, P=.0001,
 
\begin_inset Formula $r^{2}$
\end_inset

 = .25).
 This is likely a reflection of differences in harvesting practices that
 favor maintaining more adult males in the northern populations, which would
 reduce rates of increase.

Findings on responses of ungulate populations to effects of winter weather

 Body condition, fecundity, and reproductive rate have shown both positive
 and negative relationships to NAO, suggesting that under some circumstances
 warm, wet winters are favorable to animals, producing a positive correlation
 with NAO, while in others cold dry winters are favorable, producing a negative
 relationship similar to the one we observed.
 Although these conflicting observations have been explained by differences
 between maritime and mainland climates, inconsistencies remain

 that population dynamics of large herbivores respond to multiple forces,
 including intrinsic effects of density dependent competition for resources
 and extrinsic effects of weather and predation.
 We show that density dependence, predation, and weather were implicated
 as controls on population growth rate of reindeer and that these influences
 were roughly equal in strength.
 In particular, our findings resemble

 who found evidence for density dependence in populations of mountain sheep
 that were harvested and preyed upon.
 It is sometimes said that populations that are routinely harvested should
 not show effects of density on population growth rate because they are
 maintained well below the carrying capacity of the environment.
 However, if feedbacks from population density to per capita population
 growth rate are approximately linear (as is the assumption in logistic
 population growth) then we would expect that effects on per capita growth
 rate would be observable at all densities.

 Our results reinforce the findings of

 strong effects on the productivity of reindeer.
 These effects of spatial context appear to result from multiple influences
 including spatial variation in primary production, weather, and differences
 in husbandry.

\begin_layout Subsection
Implications for future work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A weakness of our work is the assumption that abundance of predators is
 estimated without error
\series bold
,
\series default
 although our fundamental conclusion about effects of predators appeared
 to be robust to this assumption (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Observation_error"

\end_inset

).
 Nonetheless, substantial improvements could be made in our ability to estimate
 and forecast effects of predators on reindeer by including uncertainty
 in these estimates.
 We strongly urge the development of statistically rigorous methods for
 estimating predator abundance, methods that would allow a proper observation
 model for the predator data.
 Similarly, estimates of reindeer numbers could be enhanced by methods that
 would allow assessment of variance in observations and potential bias in
 census.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, given that animals are handled a few times per year, it would
 be relatively easy to implement a mark-recapture design to estimate total
 numbers and vital rates.
 These data would enable development of age and sex structured models, which
 we believe are particularly needed given our observation that variation
 in husbandry practices, mediated through demography, may be at least partially
 responsible for variation in harvest along the north-south gradient.
 Age-structured models are needed to better explain the operation of density
 dependence 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Bonenfant:2009uq"

\end_inset

.
 In earlier work we attempted to develop these models, but the absence of
 data on the sex composition of the calf harvest proved to be an impediment
 that could not be overcome because the proportion of calves in the harvest
 could trade-off with the unobserved parameter of calf survival, making
 these parameters inestimable.
 Adding observations of the sex ratio of the calf harvest to the reindeer
 database could markedly enhance future models of predator impacts with
 virtually no added expense for sampling.

Implications for policy

Throughout Scandinavia, there are conflicting goals for sustaining the pastoral

 of productivity of reindeer resulting from effects of native predators.
 Owners of predator-killed livestock are usually compensated based on documented
 losses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, whereas the Swedish system is risk-based.
 In a risk-based compensation the reindeer herders can focus on reindeer
 husbandry, instead of searching for predator-killed reindeer.
 There is also an incentive for reindeer owners to invest in mitigation
 measures to reduce losses, e.g.
 keeping reindeer females in enclosures during calving and a few weeks thereafte
r.
 A risk-based compensation scheme excludes the need to directly observe
 predator kills, but nonetheless requires defensible estimates of damage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Heretofore, the Swedish risk-based system was not based on quantified effects
 of predators on reindeer, and as a result, could be criticized as an unjustifie
d subsidy.

 used individual lynx kill-rate on reindeer as an estimate of losses that
 could be used for setting compensation levels.
 We offer evidence that native predators meaningfully reduce the number
 of reindeer that could be harvested relative to harvests that would occur
 in the absence of predators.
 However, we also show that although the absolute impacts of predation on
 reindeer harvest are proportionate to predator abundance in a management
 unit, the relative impacts are disproportionate.
 Proportional reductions in potential harvests within management units were
 relatively small where reindeer populations were large (Fig.

 management unit were small.
