Understanding the feedbacks that create resilience in alternative states
 of ecosystems forms a central challenge in contemporary ecology, providing
 the conceptual basis for the practice of ecosystem restoration.
 The reintroduction of the gray wolf (
\emph on
Canis lupus
\series default
)
\series medium
\emph default
 to the landscapes of the northern range of Yellowstone National Park offers
 an unusual opportunity to understand how restructuring a food web acts
 to change the state of an ecosystem.
 Wolves were extirpated from Yellowstone during the early twentieth century,
 and the simplified food web that resulted is believed to have caused a
 state change in riparian ecosystems.
 Extensive observational evidence suggests that release of the population
 of elk (
\emph on
Cervus elaphus)
\emph default
 from control by wolves and consequent elevated herbivory caused a shift
 in riparian plant communities from willows to grasslands.
 Coincident with these changes, a major source of disturbance--dam building
 by beaver--ceased to influence the hydrology of the small stream network.
 The loss of engineering by beaver degraded habitat for willows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone in 1995.
 It has been hypothesized that behavioral and numerical effects of wolves
 on elk initiated a trophic cascade, causing a rapid and dramatic reversal
 of ecosystem state from grassland to willow.
 We have been working for a decade to test the trophic cascade hypothesis
 and to understand the role of top-down and bottom-up forces in controlling
 the state of riparian ecosystems on the northern range.
 A 10-year factorial experiment manipulating herbivory and water availability
 found little support for the operation of a linear, trophic cascade.
 Instead, we observed a composite of top-down and bottom-up controls and
 counter-intuitive feedbacks resulting from removing herbivory.
 Browsing intensity on willows remained static in the face of large reductions
 in the number of elk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is vital to the discipline of ecology and the practice of restoration
 that the feedbacks created by the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone
 be accurately understood over the fullness of time.
 The abundance of elk has only recently declined to levels that prevailed
 during the first half of the twentieth century, the period when state change
 is believed to have occurred.
 Thus, it is plausible that there has not been sufficient time for top-down
 effects of wolves on elk to release willows from effects of herbivory.
 Here, we propose long-term research to understand how climate, hydrology,
 and trophic dynamics act to control the state of riparian ecosystems on
 Yellowstone's northern range.
 We will continue our manipulative experiment, supplementing it with landscape-s
cale observations.
 We will assimilate our measurements in a fully Bayesian, state-space model
 to evaluate how ungulate numbers and patterns of predation risk explain
 spatiotemporal variation in browsing intensity and willow growth.
 We will use the model to determine how trophic effects are modified by
 climate and hydrology.
 Using our ongoing experiment, we will examine legacy effects of water stress
 on willows growing on historic floodplains as a potential, mechanistic
 explanation for time lags in trophic effects.
 We will determine if shifts in the composition of the community of large
 herbivores can explain temporally static patterns of browsing intensity
 or if those patterns are better explained by an absolute shortage of food
 created by snow accumulation during winter.

 Resilience is a property of communities and ecosystems that determines
 their propensity to reorganize to their original condition after disturbance.

 desirable states, the concept applies equally to restoring degraded ones---in
 both cases resilient states resist change

, recognized that communities and ecosystems can exist in alternative states
 of biotic and physical organization, states that can shift abruptly, one
 to another.
 State change can be triggered by biotic or abiotic stress, leading to temporary
 or enduring re-organization of system structure and function.
 Of particular interest are alternative states that are resilient, that
 resist return to the original state even when the triggering stressor is
 removed.
 For example, in coastal marine ecosystems, over-harvest of top predators
 has caused a potentially irreversible change in fisheries because juvenile
 predators are outcompeted by their prey species.
 Although excessive harvest may have caused the state change, reducing the
 number of fish taken is not sufficient to recover the fishery

 In grasslands throughout the world, heavy grazing has reduced plant standing
 crops and caused shifts in the composition of plant communities, producing
 feedbacks that reduced soil fertility and water infiltration.
 Although excessive grazing may have caused the state change, moderating

 soils

 Beaver dams punctuated the stream network, flooded large areas of the landscape

 the life-history requirements of willows.

 It has been hypothesized that the prevailing grassland state along stream
 corridors has recently reorganized to the willow state as a result of a
 trophic cascade caused by the successful restoration of wolves to Yellowstone
 in 1995.
 The central idea in the trophic cascade hypothesis is that the direct effects
 of wolves on elk numbers and their indirect effects on elk foraging behavior
 have released willows from top-down control by herbivory and have promoted
 a rapid recovery in willow biomass, distribution, and stature

If a state-change has occurred as a result of the restoration of wolves
 to Yellowstone, then the following outcomes should have occurred along
 the floodplains of small streams during the last decade: 1) Ungulate herbivory
 on willows was moderate and declining; 2) Growth of willows that were artificia
lly protected from browsing resembled growth of willows that were ostensibly
 protected from browsing by trophic effects of wolves; 3) Recovery of willows
 was not limited by availability of water or other resources, and most important
ly, 4) Willows increased dramatically in height and biomass.
 The failure to observe these outcomes shows that the state of riparian
 ecosystems currently remains resilient to disturbance of the food web caused
 by the reintroduction of an apex predator.

 Each of the four replicates consisted of four 0.02 ha plots.
 Each plot was randomly assigned to a treatment combination.
 The undammed, unfenced plots represented the ambient condition, and we

 If willows reach this height, then the recovered willow state can be reasonably
 expected to be resilient to ungulate herbivory, even in the face of episodicall

 In addition to willow height, biomass is an important indicator of state
 reorganization because beaver cannot reoccupy areas they historically colonized
 without an adequate food supply provided by willow and other woody deciduous
 plants.
 Moreover, beaver must have access to stems of sufficient length and thickness

Average height of willows experiencing ambient browsing and moisture conditions
 (i.e., controls) increased 28 cm relative to pre-treatment means, an average
 rate of increase of only 3.4 cm /year (Figure 2B).
 At this rate of growth, willows in control plots would require an additional
 34 years to reach the 250 cm resilience threshold.
 It is important to remember that these plants were ostensibly

 Height increases of unbrowsed willows with ambient water tables were more

 The combined effects of raised water tables and protection from browsing

 Despite high levels of browsing in unfenced plots, the exclosure effect
 size was small relative to the dam effect size (Figure 2B) because willows
 in dammed, browsed plots grew rapidly despite intense browsing.

 We discovered that increased moisture stress resulted from effects of protectio

 Unbrowsed plants had narrower stems and more age and branch junctions between
 the soil and the leaves than browsed plants did, and these morphological
 differences reduced water-use efficiency by unbrowsed plants relative to
 browsed ones.

 after nine years of protection from browsing, while rates of biomass accumulati

 This feedback suggests that the alternative, grassland state is resilient

 are not consistent with the hypothesis that the northern range of Yellowstone
 National Park has experienced a state change resulting from a trophic cascade
 following the reintroduction of wolves.
 Despite dramatic reductions in elk numbers during the course of our studies
 (Figure 1A), browsing on unfenced plots remained intense and did not differ
 qualitatively from pre-wolf levels.
 Willows experiencing ambient browsing and water tables increased nominally
 in height.
 After almost a decade of complete protection from browsing, growth rates
 of willows in exclosed plots with ambient water tables were decelerating
 and their heights remained far below the 200-250 cm resilience threshold.
 There was strong evidence for bottom-up limitation of willow growth by
 availability of water.
 We revealed complex feedbacks creating resilience in system state: eliminating
 browsing amplified moisture stress and retarded photosynthetic rate of
 willows on historic flood plains.
 Thus, none of the four outcomes consistent with the trophic cascade hypothesis
 (i.e., page 3, paragraph 3) were unambiguously realized in our experiment.
 Instead, we showed clear evidence of the simultaneous operation of top-down
 and bottom-up controls on state change in the riparian zone of the northern
 range.
 Our results are reinforced by the observational studies of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 who also found evidence of bottom-up control; sites with tall willows had
 greater water availability, more rapid net soil nitrogen mineralization,
 greater snow depth, lower soil respiration rates, and cooler summer soil
 temperatures than nearby sites with short willows.

During 2008, we initiated studies to understand the results of our fine-scale,
 manipulative experiment in the context of variation in willow growth at
 large scales of time and space.
 To enhance our understanding of controls on willow growth at larger spatial
 scales, we established 23 plots at sites historically occupied by beaver
 across the northern range using spatially balanced random sampling 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ISI:000247338100013"

\end_inset

.
 On each plot, we permanently marked 8 to 15 stems on 4 to 6 plants (318
 stems on 115 plants across all sites) and measured annual increments in
 willow height and biomass, browsing intensity, and water table depth using
 the same methods as used in our experiment (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 
\end_layout

Observations of willow heights in the control plots of our experiment were
 representative of variation at the landscape scale (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

).
 The posterior distribution of mean heights in control plots (experiencing
 ambient browsing and water) fell in the center of the distribution of individua
l heights of willows on the landscape (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Posterior-distributions-of"

\end_inset

).
 The posterior distribution of mean height in the dammed, browsed treatment
 spanned much of the upper tail of the landscape distribution of heights.
 This comparison shows that the variation in willow growth caused by treatments
 in our experiments was also seen at the landscape scale, suggesting that
 although the average response of the system offered evidence of resilience
 to perturbation, the average response belied variation indicating that
 state change may be occurring in some locations

\begin_layout Standard
To understand large-scale temporal variation in willow height, we used dendrochr
onological methods to estimate age of willows differing in height across
 the 23 sites.
 Using samples of plants varying in age, we obtained data on willow height
 at different points in time by sectioning stems every 10 cm and counting
 growth rings on each section.
 Using relationships between stem age and height, we reconstructed establishment
 and growth of 298 willow stems, spanning establishment years from 1972
 to 2006.
 We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to examine controls on willow height
 at the landscape scale, evaluating the strength of evidence for models
 predicting height growth over time from plant age and corresponding annual
 counts of elk, wolves, and bison, total annual precipitation, duration
 of the growing season (as growing degree days), and random effects for
 site, willow species, and year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found overwhelming support for a model predicting willow height based
 on stem age, elk numbers, growing degree days, and the interaction of age
 with elk numbers and growing degree days (
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

DIC to next best model = 80).
 This model is consistent with the hypothesis of a numerically mediated
 trophic cascade caused by reductions in abundance of elk due to predation
 by wolves, but also shows that willow growth depended on the climatic context.
 A multi-year trend toward longer growing seasons allowed greater height
 growth during the spring and summer for older stems (>14 years), but decreased
 growth rates of younger stems.
  We also observed an intriguing interaction between elk numbers and stem
 age: the effect of elk numbers on growth rate of young stems (<8 years
 old) was 
\emph on
positive
\emph default
, suggesting that browsing may stimulate growth rates when stems are young.
 Thus, the results of our large-scale analyses amplify the central result
 of our experiment, that state change is likely to be controlled by the
 interplay of top-down and bottom-up forces, that the climatic context matters,
 and that trophic feedbacks do not operate in a simple, linear fashion.
 However, the large-scale analysis also reinforces the possibility that
 a numerical trophic cascade can be discerned.

The reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone's northern range represents
 one of the most significant natural experiments in the history of ecology,
 offering an exceptional opportunity to understand how disturbance of food
 webs interacts with climate and the physical environment to determine the
 state of an ecosystem.
 It is important to the discipline of ecology and the practice of conservation
 that this story be told fully and accurately.

.
 It remains unclear if the northern range will return to a resilient willow
 state, and if it does, what forces will drive or oppose that transition.
 Our observational and experimental work suggest a complex set of controls
 on alternative ecosystem states, a pattern largely inconsistent with the
 linear trophic forcing that has been hypothesized

 However, we do 
\emph on

 argue that our work refutes the idea that restoration of an apex predator
 has fundamentally modified feedbacks controlling the state of the ecosystem.
 Rather, we contend that these feedbacks remain only partially understood,
 and that a full understanding depends on measuring them as they unfold
 over time and space.
 It is imperative to recognize that the abundance of elk has only recently
 reached levels that are below the number that were present during the period
 when the state-change is believed to have occurred (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:A.-Elk-population-and-beavers"

A).
 Thus, it is entirely plausible that a numerically-mediated trophic cascade
 has not had sufficient time to be manifest, let alone observed.
 The change in riparian state from willow to grassland required the better
 part of a century (Wolf et al., 2007)(Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Why would we think that its reversal would be plainly revealed 15 years

Predictions and questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two, competing predictions motivated by our previous work frame a decade
 of future experimentation and observation: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The grassland state will be replaced by the willow state.
 The addition of a top predator to the food web has not yet caused responses
 in height and biomass of willows because there has been insufficient time
 for numerically-mediated effects on elk to become evident and because a
 legacy of shallow root development of willows on historic floodplains has
 retarded their growth.
 During the coming decade, we will observe widespread return of the willow
 state to the small streams of the northern range.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Alternatively, the grassland state is resilient to the addition of a top
 predator and will not be replaced by willow.
 Resilience is created by effects of hydrologic processes and climate.
 In addition, an increasing bison population may compensate for the top-down
 effects of wolves on elk.
 Slow progress toward the willow state will be episodically reversed by
 winter weather that amplifies browsing intensity and resets the landscape
 to the grassland condition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is a relatively straightforward problem to discriminate between these
 predictions, if not the mechanisms they represent.
 Prediction 1 is refuted if there is no rightward shift in the height distributi
on of individually-marked willows (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Posterior-distributions-of"

\end_inset

).
 Prediction 2 is refuted if such a shift occurs.
 An additional decade of observations of willow height and biomass of willows
 at our experimental and observational sites will allow us to differentiate
 among these futures, an important result in itself.
 However, a far more important goal is to understand the mechanisms that
 give rise to the future condition of the landscape.
 This understanding depends on answering three questions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How do climate and hydrology modify the effects of a restructured food web
 to explain spatial and temporal variation in willow growth?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Are willows on historic floodplains locked into a slow growing state as
 a result of changes in hydrology or are they approaching change-points
 in above-ground growth allowed by root development?

 of wolves to the food web and their top-down effects on elk numbers?

 In the work proposed here, we recast this question to ask about the relative
 strength and interdependencies of trophic, hydrologic, and climatic controls
 on ecosystem state.
 To address this question, we will model the dynamics of willow growth over
 time and space using a fully Bayesian, state-space approach (Figure

 Currently, only 2% of the stems we measured were browsed during summer.
 We conclude these effects are minor.
 If the intensity of summer browsing increases, we are prepared to include

 water, duration of growing season, spring and summer precipitation, previous
 winter's browsing intensity).
 In so doing, it provides a way to quantify the relative strength of top-down
 and bottom-up controls within a changing context created by climate.
 Although it is simple, our modeling approach is able to portray change-points
 that result from changes in the balance between growth and removals.
 The model can represent complex feedbacks; for example, browsing can retard
 growth during winter and accelerate growth during the subsequent growing
 season (Figure

We are particularly interested in using our analysis to address competing
 hypotheses explaining observed spatial variation in willow growth (Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The first hypothesis is that browsing intensity varies over space in response
 to spatial variation in predation risk and that browsing intensity, in
 turn, explains spatial variation in willow growth 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 An alternative hypothesis is that spatial variation in willow growth is

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 To evaluate these alternatives, our model includes a spatially explicit
 covariate for predation risk derived from an updated version of the

 It will also include covariates for water table depth and groundwater use,

 hypotheses for the first time.

We will use two sampling regimes, one extensive the other intensive, to
 provide the data needed to estimate parameters and to evaluate evidence
 for alternative models.
 In the extensive regime, we will use 20 years of data from our experimental
 plots (10 past, 10 future) and 13 years of data from our landscape-scale
 plots.
 Thus, our extensive sample will include more than 500 individually marked
 plants, at 39 sites.
 Responses will include a spatially replicated time series of willow height
 and willow biomass at two time points per year (Box

 Covariates will include annual weather data (collected at the National

 The experimental sites are critical to this analysis because: 1) they will

 browsing intensity and water availability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will also deploy an intensive sampling regime that will more clearly
 reveal mechanistic controls on willow growth and that will offer greater
 spatial resolution in observations of climate.
 This regime will include all of the measurements obtained in the extensive
 sample, but will also include isotopically measured groundwater use, plant
 moisture stress, and detailed, local-scale climatic measurements.
 The intensive regime will be limited to the experimental sites and 10 additiona

 of sites (Figure

 To quantify local climate, we will establish a meteorological station in

 These stations will be used to quantify the duration of the growing season,
 soil temperature, soil water content, water table depth (using existing

 Growing season duration will be quantified as the period from bud burst
 to leaf drop using plant cams that take one photo per day of each plot.
 Soil temperature and soil water content will be measured in a vertical

 sensors.
 Water table depth will be measured daily using a submersible pressure transduce

 Precipitation during the growing season will be measured using a recording

Spatial and temporal variation in predation risk will be estimated using
 an updated version of the model of Kauffman et al.
 (2007).
 In brief, the model estimates predation risk to elk from wolves using logistic
 regression with a matched case-control design (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000),
 where relative probability of a kill on the landscape is estimated from
 the differential landscape attributes of locations where elk were killed
 by wolves compared to random locations.
 New data on wolf pack territories and elk kill locations needed to update
 the model will be provided by a collaborating LTREB project and by Yellowstone
 National Park (see Section 8.1).
 Landscape attributes used to build the model include the annual distribution
 of wolf packs (based on cumulative kernel densities and weighted by pack
 size), relative elk density (based on the habitat model of Mao et al., 2005),
 and the landscape features of proximity to streams, proximity to roads,
 habitat openness (forest vs.
 grassland), slope, and snow depth (Kauffman et al., 2007).
 In addition to providing a robust measure of predation risk to evaluate
 willow growth responses, the updating to the Kauffman et al.
 (2007) risk map with an additional decade of wolf kills will provide the
 most extensive time series of spatial predation patterns known to the PIs.
 This is important because spatial and temporal inconsistencies of cues
 for risk generated by wide ranging predators such as wolves can erode the
 behaviorally mediated signal of trophic cascades

Does root development create a time lag for state transition?

\begin_layout Standard
A compelling explanation for our observations of slow growth in willows
 is a legacy effect created by shallow root development interacting with
 herbivory.
 Willows that established on flood plains around beaver ponds 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Wolf:2007kc"

\end_inset

 likely experienced shallow water tables and in response, developed roots
 near the surface of the flood plain, root systems that assured plants would
 experience moisture stress when water tables declined following beaver
 dam abandonment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Johnston:2007ye,Bilyeu:2008pd"

 The concomitant stress of excessive herbivory may have prevented established
 willows from growing deeper root systems in response to declining water
 tables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, it is possible that slow but positive above-ground growth in ambient
 willows (Figure 2B) belies root expansion below ground.
 This is important because our experimental studies revealed that plants
 with access to groundwater could withstand high levels of browsing; they
 rapidly accumulated canopy height and biomass despite removals of more
 than half of their production each winter 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Johnston:2007ye,Bilyeu:2008pd"

\end_inset

.
 If root growth increases access to groundwater in plants with ambient water
 tables, then these plants might be approaching a threshold when they can
 tolerate browsing, thereby creating positive feedbacks accelerating growth.
 If plants in the ambient condition are approaching this threshold, we predict
 the proportion of their water budget contributed by groundwater will increase
 over time, and their water stress will decrease.
 We predict that growth rates of plants on sites with deep water tables
 will approach growth rates of plants on sites with shallow water tables,
 leading to local state transition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our ongoing experiment is poised to test these predictions by allowing a
 long-term comparison between willows with ambient water tables and willows
 with elevated water tables.

 To determine the proportion of each plant's water budget contributed by
 ground water during the growing season, we will collect samples of: 1)
 ground-water from 6-10 existing wells at each site, 2) an integrated soil

 methods.
 Water samples will be analyzed for Œ¥18O on a mass spectrometer.

 Treatment will be analyzed as a fixed effect and year as a random effect

One of the most counter-intuitive results of our studies was the finding
 that browsing intensity remained virtually constant during 2003-2010 and
 resembled pre-wolf browsing intensity observed during 1987-1991 (Figure
 2A).
 This result implies that browsing intensity is largely insensitive to elk
 numbers.
 It has been suggested that browsing on willows is better explained by behaviora
l effects of wolves on elk than by numerical effects.
 However, recent work showed that effects of predation risk on behavior
 are in the opposite direction of those predicted by a behaviorally mediated
 trophic cascade

There are two potential explanations for this paradox.
 The first is that a shift in the composition of the food web has caused
 total demand for plant biomass by large herbivores to remain largely unchanged
 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Numbers_biomass"

\end_inset

).
 Although the number of elk on the northern range declined steeply during
 the past decade in response to predation by wolves, drought, and hunter
 harvest outside the park 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Vucetich:2005gb,Eberhardt:2007jb"

\end_inset

, the number of bison (
\emph on

\emph default
 on the northern range concomitantly increased (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

), possibly as a consequence of reduced interspecific competition with elk
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "White:2005fk"

\end_inset

.
 The body mass of bison is roughly twice the mass of elk, so increases in
 bison numbers allowed total herbivore biomass to decline only slightly
 in the face of steeply declining elk numbers (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Numbers_biomass"

\end_inset

).
 Because daily dry matter intake of ruminants is directly proportionate
 to their body mass 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Demment_1985"

\end_inset

, we would expect that browsing pressure would remain approximately constant
 if bison consume willow.
 American bison are considered to be predominantly grazers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "as are elk,"
key "Christianson:2007rw"

\end_inset

.
 However, willow can dominate bison diets 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Waggoner:1986vn"

\end_inset

.
 Thus, a parsimonious explanation for constant browsing pressure is that
 bison maintained removal rates as the elk population declined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second explanation is that there are periods during winter when there
 is an absolute shortage of food for large herbivores on the northern range.
 During winter, the herbaceous layer can be episodically covered by deep
 and compact snow.
 There is a substantial literature showing that elk increase consumption
 of woody plants when accumulated snow blocks access to the herb layer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "reviewed by"
key "Christianson:2007rw,Creel:2009fe"

\end_inset

.
 During these episodes, the total supply of plant biomass available to large
 herbivores may be less that the total intake requirements of even a small
 herbivore population 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g., "
key "Wallmo:1977fh,Hobbs_ebal_model"

\end_inset

.
 Under these circumstances, removal rates would be uncoupled from herbivore
 abundance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These two explanations are not necessarily competing, and we will evaluate
 evidence for both.
 To understand how restructuring of the food web may influence the strength
 of top down control of willows, we need to know which herbivore species
 are responsible for browsing removals.
 We will use molecular techniques to determine the species of ungulates
 consuming willows.
 When browsers crop bites, small amounts of saliva containing buccal cells
 are left on residual stems.
 Co-PI Spong has developed techniques for extracting sufficient DNA from
 browsed stems for analysis by diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
 methods.
 Based on mitochondrial sequence data, Spong's lab has designed species
 specific genetic markers that amplify only the target species.
 DNA can be successfully extracted from twigs for up to four months after
 browsing, and the extraction is successful on about 70% of samples.
 We have tested the methods on willows browsed by bison and elk in a blind,
 controlled experiment and were able to correctly identify the browser on
 all successfully amplified samples.
 All samples are extracted by a Qiagen¬Æ robot using a protocol optimized
 together with Qiagen‚Äôs application laboratory.
 Samples are currently run on RT-PCR machines from Applied Biosystems¬Æ.
 We will sample four willow browsed stems from different plants from each
 of our study sites during early January and late March of each winter (n
 = 60 per date) and will determine the proportion of browsing that is attributab
le to elk and bison.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will evaluate the variation in browsing intensity explained by snow at
 our experimental and observational sites.
 The effects of snow on ungulate foraging are widely assumed to be important
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hobbs_ebal_model,Turner:1993bs,Turner:1994uq,Tyler:2010kx"

, but the functional relationship between characteristics of snow and effects
 of browsers on plants remains unknown.
 Understanding how temporal variation in snow characteristics influences
 browsing requires that we supplement the annual observations of browsing
 intensity obtained for the willow growth model (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 To that end, we will make bi-weekly measurements of mass removed from willows

 The candidate set of models will include: 1) monotonic relationships where
 increasing snowpack leads to increasing browsing, 2) change-points, where
 threshold snow characteristics lead to qualitative shifts in browsing,
 and 3) modal relationships, where increases in snowpack eventually lead
 to declines in willow browsing as plants become inaccessible.
 Independent variables will include snowpack depth and water equivalents

A decade of work has revealed an alternative state in Yellowstone and a
 set of feedbacks that currently stabilize that state.
 Despite the addition of wolves to the food web and a dramatic reduction
 in elk numbers (Figure 2A), browsing on willows remains intense (Figure
 1A).
 The absence of beaver dams has compressed habitat for willows (Wolf et
 al., 2007) and has caused water stress on willows that established on flood
 plains along channels historically dammed by beavers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Johnston:2007ye"

 Water stress retards willow growth, even when they are totally protected
 from browsing (Bilyeau et al., 2008; Marshall et al., in prep.), and removing
 browsing amplifies the growth-inhibiting effects of water stress 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 We detected effects of reduced elk numbers and an expanding growing season
 on willow growth at the landscape scale (Marshall et al, in prep.).
 However, these effects are not simple; both depend on plant age.
 We have shown that there is enormous spatial variability in heights of
 willows (Figure

 Five more years of research will almost certainly double the number of
 observations of the effects of elk at these low levels, thereby giving
 a numerically mediated trophic cascade an honest chance to be observed.
 Moreover, our experiment will allow us to determine if the current, slow
 growth of willows is due to legacy effects of shallow root development.
 We will be able to test competing hypotheses on the role of predation risk
 and water availability in controlling spatial variation in willow growth.
 We will know if bison are contributing to browsing pressure on willows.
 Finally, we will have the data to resolve important climate effects, particular
ly the effects of snow, that now remain uncertain.
 In five years, we will have 232 data points (12 years x 4 experimental
 sites + 8 years x 23 observational sites) on browsing intensity paired
 with site-specific, instrument-calibrated, model estimates of a suite of
 snow characteristics.
 We will also be able to exploit an unusually important opportunity created
