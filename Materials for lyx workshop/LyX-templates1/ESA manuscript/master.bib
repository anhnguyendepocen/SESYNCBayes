	Abstract = {Density-dependence is a key concept in population dynamics. Here, we review how body mass and demographic parameters vary with population density in large herbivores. The demographic parameters we consider are age- and sex-specific reproduction, survival and dispersal. As population density increases, the body mass of large herbivores typically declines, affecting individual performance traits such as age of first reproduction and juvenile survival. We documented density-dependent variations in reproductive rates for many species from the Arctic to subtropical zones, both with and without predation. At high density, a trade-off between growth and reproduction delays the age of primiparity and often increases the costs of reproduction, decreasing both survival and future reproductive success of adult females. Density-dependent preweaning juvenile survival occurs more often in polytocous than monotocous species, while the effects of density on post-weaning juvenile survival are independent of litter size. Responses of adult survival to density are much less marked than for juvenile survival, and may be exaggerated by density-dependent changes in age structure. The role of density-dependent dispersal in population dynamics remains uncertain, because very few studies have examined it. For sexually dimorphic species, we found little support for higher sensitivity to increasing density in the life history traits of males compared to females, except for young age classes. It remains unclear whether males of dimorphic species are sensitive to male density, female density or a combination of both. Eberhardt's model predicting a sequential effect of density on demographic parameters (from juvenile survival to adult survival) was supported by 9 of 10 case studies. In addition, population density at birth can also lead to cohort effects, including a direct effect on juvenile survival and long-term effects on average cohort performance as adults. Density effects typically interact with weather, increasing in strength in years of harsh weather. For some species, the synchronization between plant phenology and reproductive cycle is a key process in population dynamics. The timing of late gestation as a function of plant phenology determines whether density-dependence influences juvenile survival or adult female reproduction. The detection of density-dependence can be made difficult by nonlinear relationships with density, high sampling variability, lagged responses to density changes, changes in population age structure, and temporal variation in the main factors limiting population growth. The negative feedbacks of population size on individual performance, and hence on life history traits, are thus only expected in particular ecological contexts and are most often restricted to certain age-specific demographic traits.},

	Abstract = {1. Size relationships are central in structuring trophic linkages within food webs, leading to suggestions that the dietary niche of smaller carnivores is nested within that of larger species. However, past analyses have not taken into account the differing selection shown by carnivores for specific size ranges of prey, nor the extent to which the greater carcass mass of larger prey outweighs the greater numerical representation of smaller prey species in the predator diet. Furthermore, the top-down impact that predation has on prey abundance cannot be assessed simply in terms of the number of predator species involved. 2. Records of found carcasses and cause of death assembled over 46 years in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, corrected for under-recording of smaller species, enabled a definitive assessment of size relationships between large mammalian carnivores and their ungulate prey. Five carnivore species were considered, including lion (Panthera leo), leopard (Panthera pardus), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) and spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), and 22 herbivore prey species larger than 10 kg in adult body mass. 3. These carnivores selectively favoured prey species approximately half to twice their mass, within a total prey size range from an order of magnitude below to an order of magnitude above the body mass of the predator. The three smallest carnivores, i.e. leopard, cheetah and wild dog, showed high similarity in prey species favoured. Despite overlap in prey size range, each carnivore showed a distinct dietary preference. 4. Almost all mortality was through the agency of a predator for ungulate species up to the size of a giraffe (800-1200 kg). Ungulates larger than twice the mass of the predator contributed substantially to the dietary intake of lions, despite the low proportional mortality inflicted by predation on these species. Only for megaherbivores substantially exceeding 1000 kg in adult body mass did predation become a negligible cause of mortality. 5. Hence, the relative size of predators and prey had a pervasive structuring influence on biomass fluxes within this large-mammal food web. Nevertheless, the large carnivore assemblage was dominated overwhelmingly by the largest predator, which contributed the major share of animals killed across a wide size range.},

@article{LaDeau:2011lh,
	Abstract = {Ecologists worldwide are challenged to contribute solutions to urgent and pressing environmental problems by forecasting how populations, communities, and ecosystems will respond to global change. Rising to this challenge requires organizing ecological information derived from diverse sources and formally assimilating data with models of ecological processes. The study of infectious disease has depended on strategies for integrating patterns of observed disease incidence with mechanistic process models since John Snow first mapped cholera cases around a London water pump in 1854. Still, zoonotic and vector-borne diseases increasingly affect human populations, and methods used to successfully characterize directly transmitted diseases are often insufficient. We use four case studies to demonstrate that advances in disease forecasting require better understanding of zoonotic host and vector populations, as well of the dynamics that facilitate pathogen amplification and disease spillover into humans. In each case study, this goal is complicated by limited data, spatiotemporal variability in pathogen transmission and impact, and often, insufficient biological understanding. We present a conceptual framework for data-model fusion in infectious disease research that addresses these fundamental challenges using a hierarchical state-space structure to (1) integrate multiple data sources and spatial scales to inform latent parameters, (2) partition uncertainty in process and observation models, and (3) explicitly build upon existing ecological and epidemiological understanding. Given the constraints inherent in the study of infectious disease and the urgent need for progress, fusion of data and expertise via this type of conceptual framework should prove an indispensable tool.},

	Abstract = {There has been growing interest in the estimation of transition probabilities among stages (Hestbeck et al., 1991; Brownie et al., 1993; Schwarz et al., 1993) in tag-return and capture-recapture models. This has been driven by the increasing interest in meta-population models in ecology and the need for parameter estimates to use in these models. These transition probabilities are composed of survival and movement rates, which can only be estimated separately when an additional assumption is made (Brownie et al., 1993). Brownie et al. (1993) assumed that movement occurs at the end of the interval between time i and i + 1. We generalize this work to allow different movement patterns in the interval for multiple tag-recovery and capture-recapture experiments. The time of movement is a random variable with a known distribution. The model formulations can be viewed as matrix extensions to the model formulations of single open population capture-recapture and tag-recovery experiments (Jolly, 1965; Seber, 1965; Brownie et al., 1985). We also present the results of a small simulation study for the tag-return model when movement time follows a beta distribution, and later another simulation study for the capture-recapture model when movement time follows a uniform distribution. The simulation studies use a modified program SURVIV (White, 1983). The Relative Standard Errors (RSEs) of estimates according to high and low movement rates are presented. We show there are strong correlations between movement and survival estimates in the case that the movement rate is high. We also show that estimators of movement rates to different areas and estimators of survival rates in different areas have substantial correlations.},

@article{Weladji:2008kl,
	Abstract = {Reproductive allocation at one age is predicted to reduce the probability of surviving to the next year or to lead to a decrease in future reproduction. This prediction assumes that reproduction involves fitness costs. However, few empirical studies have assessed whether such costs may vary with the age at primiparity or might be overridden by heterogeneities in individual quality. We used data from 35 years' monitoring of individually marked semi-domestic reindeer females to investigate fitness costs of reproduction. Using multi-state statistical models, we compared age-specific survival and reproduction among four reproductive states (never reproduced, experienced non-breeders, reproduced but did not wean offspring, and reproduced and weaned offspring) and among contrasted age at primiparity. We assessed whether reproductive costs occurred, resulting in a trade-off between current reproduction and future reproduction or survival, and whether early maturation was costly or rather reflected differences in individual quality of survival and reproduction capabilities. We did not find any evidence for fitness costs of reproduction in female reindeer. We found no cost of gestation and lactation in terms of future reproduction and survival. Conversely, successful breeders had higher survival and subsequent reproductive success than experienced non-breeders and unsuccessful breeders, independently of the age at primiparity. Moreover, it was beneficial to mature earlier, especially for females that successfully weaned their first offspring. Successful females at early primiparity remained successful throughout their life, clearly supporting the existence of marked among-female differences in quality. The weaning success peaked for multiparous females and was lower for first-time breeders, indicating a positive effect of experience on reproductive performance. Our findings emphasize an overwhelming importance of individual quality and experience to account for observed variation in survival and reproductive patterns of female reindeer that override trade-offs between current reproduction and future performance, at least in the absence of harsh winters.},

	Abstract = {Sylvatic plague (Yersinia pestis) is an exotic pathogen that is highly virulent in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) and causes widespread colony losses and individual mortality rates >95%. We investigated colony spatial characteristics that may influence inter-colony transmission of plague at 3 prairie dog colony complexes in the Great Plains. The 4 spatial characteristics we considered include: colony size, Euclidean distance to nearest neighboring colony, colony proximity index, and distance to nearest drainage (dispersal) corridor. We used multi-state mark-recapture models to determine the relationship between these colony characteristics and probability of plague transmission among prairie dog colonies. Annual mapping of colonies and mark-recapture analyses of disease dynamics in natural colonies led to 4 main results: 1) plague outbreaks exhibited high spatial and temporal variation, 2) the site of initiation of epizootic plague may have substantially influenced the subsequent inter-colony spread of plague, 3) the long-term effect of plague on individual colonies differed among sites because of how individuals and colonies were distributed, and 4) colony spatial characteristics were related to the probability of infection at all sites although the relative importance and direction of relationships varied among sites. Our findings suggest that conventional prairie dog conservation management strategies, including promoting large, highly connected colonies, may need to be altered in the presence of plague.

@inbook{Lebreton:2009fy,
	Abstract = {Many fields of science begin with a phase of exploration and description, followed by investigations of the processes that account for observed patterns. The science of ecology is no exception, and recent decades have seen a focus on understanding key processes underlying the dynamics of ecological systems. In population ecology, emphasis has shifted from the state variable of population size to the demographic processes responsible for changes in this state variable: birth, death, immigration, and emigration. In evolutionary ecology, some of these same demographic processes, rates of birth and death, are also the determinants of fitness. In animal population ecology, the estimation of state variables and their associated vital rates is especially problematic because of the difficulties in sampling such populations and detecting individual animals. Indeed, early capture-recapture models were developed for the purpose of estimating population size, given the reality that all animals are not caught or detected at any sampling occasion. More recently, capture-recapture models for open populations were developed to draw inferences about survival in the face of these same sampling problems. The focus of this paper is on multi-state mark-recapture models (MSMR), which first appeared in the 1970s but have undergone substantial development in the last 15 years. These models were developed to deal explicitly with biological variation, in that animals in different "states" (classes defined by location, physiology, behavior, reproductive status, etc.) may have different probabilities of survival and detection. Animal transitions between states are also stochastic and themselves of interest. These general models have proven to be extremely useful and provide a way of thinking about a remarkably wide range of important ecological processes. These methods are now at a stage of refinement and sophistication where they can readily be used by biologists to tackle a wide range of important issues in ecology. In this paper, we draw together information on the state of the art in multistate mark-recapture methods, explaining the models and illustrating their use. We provide a modeling philosophy and a series of general principles on how to conduct analyses. We cover key issues and features, and we anticipate the ways in which we expect the models to develop in the years ahead. In particular: MSMR can now be used in a straightforward fashion by population biologists, thanks to the development of sound goodness-of-fit procedures, reliable parameter identifiability diagnostics, and robust user-friendly computer software. Con strained models and model selection procedures can be used in the ANOVA-like philosophy commonly used over the last 15 years for survival models, to answer a variety of biological questions. We develop as an example a treatment of meadow vole Microtus pennsylvanicus data. As in survival models, random effects should be an integral part of this philosophy. Some simple approaches to random effects are illustrated. States can be defined in a very general way, for example, by combining several criteria, such as sites and reproductive states, and can include nonobservable states. We develop as an example a multisite recruitment model of roseate terns Sterna dougallii. MSMR models appear as a natural framework for combining different sources of information, viewed as different events that can be organized into mutually exclusive alternatives. With the available developments, MSMR models are becoming a standard tool in population biology, as shown by a rapid growth of their use in the literature. In particular, given the ease with which a variety of constrained models can now be developed, MSMR models appear as less data hungry than was often feared. MSMR models make it also possible to unify a large array of methodology, and, as such, are both a step towards further unification in a "mother of all" model, and a sound basis for further generalizations. Future developments concern a variety or generalizations such as the reverse time approach and population size estimation. "Multievent" models, accounting for uncertainty in state determination, and integrated state-space models are key generalizations already in full development.},

	Abstract = {Mark-recapture models are valuable for assessing diverse demographic and behavioural parameters, yet the precision of traditional estimates is often constrained by sparse empirical data. Bayesian inference explicitly recognizes estimation uncertainty, and hierarchical Bayes has proven particularly useful for dealing with sparseness by combining information across data sets. We developed a general hierarchical Bayesian multi-state mark-recapture model, tested its performance on simulated data sets and applied it to real ecological data on stopovers by migratory birds. Our hierarchical model performed well in terms of both precision and accuracy of parameters when tested with simulated data of varying quality (sample size, capture and survivorship probabilities). It also provided more precise and accurate parameter estimates than a non-hierarchical model when data were sparse. A specific version of the model, designed for estimation of daily transience and departure of migratory birds at a mid-route stopover, was applied to 11 years of autumn migration data from Atlantic Canada. Hierarchical estimates of departure and transience were more precise than those derived from parallel non-hierarchical and frequentist methods, and indicated that inter-annual variability in parameters suggested by these other methods was largely due to sampling error. Synthesis and applications. Estimates of demographic parameters, often derived from mark-recapture studies, provide the basis for evaluating the status of species at risk, for developing conservation and management strategies and for evaluating the results of current protocols. The hierarchical Bayesian multi-state mark-recapture model presented here permits partitioning of complex parameter variation across space or time, and the simultaneous analysis of multiple data sets results in a marked increase in the precision of estimates derived from sparse capture data. Its structural flexibility should make it a valuable tool for conservation ecologists and wildlife managers.},

	Abstract = {P>1. Dispersal is a fundamental but still poorly known process in population dynamics and several hypotheses have been proposed to explain its patterns. We studied natal and breeding dispersal and survival in a long-lived seabird, the wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans L.), and examined several hypotheses concerning dispersal patterns in birds. 2. We applied multi-state capture-recapture models to a 36-year data set (1969-2004) collected at three albatross colonies on Ile de Possession, Crozet Islands. Because the species has biennial reproduction, we introduced unobservable states in the model to account for the absence of individuals in those years. 3. Adults were highly faithful to their nesting colony but colony fidelity, as well as survival rate, differed slightly among colonies (fidelity ranged from 0 center dot 957 to 0 center dot 977). Breeding fidelity was highest in the colony where survival was lowest and individuals were not more likely to change colony following a failed breeding attempt than after a successful one. The colony that attracted most dispersers had the lowest density of nesting birds. 4. Philopatry (the probability that young return to breed at a birth site) was generally high but variable among colonies (ranging from 0 center dot 70 to 0 center dot 92), and survival of young differed little. Philopatry was highest in the largest colony, where the availability of potential mates was presumably greatest. However, among dispersing individuals, the colony that had the lowest density of nesting individuals, not the largest colony, attracted the most recruits. 5. Although size of the colony influenced the decision to stay or to leave in young, density was most influential in the selection of a new colony among both adult and young dispersers. Our results support the hypothesis that philopatry is the strategy favoured by most recruits and that conspecific attraction can explain variation in the level of philopatry among colonies but not settlement patterns among dispersing individuals.},

	Abstract = {P>1. Trade-offs among life-history traits are common because individuals have to partition limited resources between multiple traits. Reproductive costs are generally assumed to be high, resulting in reduced survival and fecundity in the following year. However, it is common to find positive rather than negative correlations between life-history traits. 2. Here, we use a data set from the individual-based study of red deer on the Isle of Rum to examine how these costs vary between individuals and at different ages, using multi-state mark-recapture methodology. 3. Females that had reproduced frequently in the past incurred lower costs of reproduction in terms of survival in the following year and were more likely to reproduce in two consecutive years. Older individuals and those that had not reproduced frequently exhibited higher costs. 4. These results highlight the importance of considering heterogeneity and individual quality when examining trade-offs and demonstrate the effectiveness of using detailed long-term data sets to explore life-history strategies using multi-state mark-recapture models.},

	Abstract = {Traditional analyses of capture-recapture data are based on likelihood functions that explicitly integrate out all missing data. We use a complete data likelihood (CDL) to show how a wide range of capture-recapture models can be easily fitted using readily available software JAGS/BUGS even when there are individual-specific time-varying covariates. The models we describe extend those that condition on first capture to include abundance parameters, or parameters related to abundance, such as population size, birth rates or lifetime. The use of a CDL means that any missing data, including uncertain individual covariates, can be included in models without the need for customized likelihood functions. This approach also facilitates modeling processes of demographic interest rather than the complexities caused by non-ignorable missing data. We illustrate using two examples, (i) open population modeling in the presence of a censored time-varying individual covariate in a full robust design, and (ii) full open population multi-state modeling in the presence of a partially observed categorical variable.

	Abstract = {The spatial scale of conservation necessary to avoid species extinctions is one of the most vigorous debates in conservation biology. One approach holds that protecting sites should be the primary level for action on the ground, the other that conservation action targeting broader seascapes and landscapes is more important. We address this debate systematically by assessing the appropriate spatial scales of conservation for all 4,239 threatened mammals, birds, tortoises and turtles, and amphibians. We find that, in the short-to medium term, 20% of these species are dependent on conservation at single sites, 62% on multiple sites, 18% on both sites and sea- or landscape-scale efforts, and <1% on broad-scale actions alone (where sites are variably sized units that are actually or could potentially be managed for conservation, and "broad scale" refers to sea- or landscape-scale and is determined by the needs of the species in question). Calls for broad-scale conservation action have generally focused on terrestrial birds and mammals, and we confirm that a fifth and a tenth of these, respectively, require conservation action at the landscape scale. However, we also find that two-fifths of threatened freshwater turtles and one-fifth of threatened amphibians depend on broad-scale conservation action to address changes in freshwater processes. Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of threatened marine mammals, birds, and turtles require urgent conservation action at the seascape scale. Our key conclusion is that neither site-scale nor broad-scale approaches alone can prevent mass extinction. Although site protection should remain the cornerstone for almost all threatened species, we demonstrate that a substantial proportion and unexpected diversity of threatened species will be lost in the absence of urgent conservation interventions at the sea- or landscape scale.},

@inbook{Bonenfant:2009fk,
	Abstract = {Density-dependence is a key concept in population dynamics. Here, we review how body mass and demographic parameters vary with population density in large herbivores. The demographic parameters we consider are age- and sex-specific reproduction, survival and dispersal. As population density increases, the body mass of large herbivores typically declines, affecting individual performance traits such as age of first reproduction and juvenile survival. We documented density-dependent variations in reproductive rates for many species from the Arctic to subtropical zones, both with and without predation. At high density, a trade-off between growth and reproduction delays the age of primiparity and often increases the costs of reproduction, decreasing both survival and future reproductive success of adult females. Density-dependent preweaning juvenile survival occurs more often in polytocous than monotocous species, while the effects of density on post-weaning juvenile survival are independent of litter size. Responses of adult survival to density are much less marked than for juvenile survival, and may be exaggerated by density-dependent changes in age structure. The role of density-dependent dispersal in population dynamics remains uncertain, because very few studies have examined it. For sexually dimorphic species, we found little support for higher sensitivity to increasing density in the life history traits of males compared to females, except for young age classes. It remains unclear whether males of dimorphic species are sensitive to male density, female density or a combination of both. Eberhardt's model predicting a sequential effect of density on demographic parameters (from juvenile survival to adult survival) was supported by 9 of 10 case studies. In addition, population density at birth can also lead to cohort effects, including a direct effect on juvenile survival and long-term effects on average cohort performance as adults. Density effects typically interact with weather, increasing in strength in years of harsh weather. For some species, the synchronization between plant phenology and reproductive cycle is a key process in population dynamics. The timing of late gestation as a function of plant phenology determines whether density-dependence influences juvenile survival or adult female reproduction. The detection of density-dependence can be made difficult by nonlinear relationships with density, high sampling variability, lagged responses to density changes, changes in population age structure, and temporal variation in the main factors limiting population growth. The negative feedbacks of population size on individual performance, and hence on life history traits, are thus only expected in particular ecological contexts and are most often restricted to certain age-specific demographic traits.},

	Abstract = {In many areas of the world, populations of native ungulates have become so abundant that they are believed to be harming vegetation and disrupting ecosystem function. Methods for controlling overabundance populations include culling animals from the population and controlling fertility using contraceptives. However, understanding the feasibility these alternatives requires insight into their long-term effects on populations. We constructed a simulation model to evaluate options for regulating elk populations in and around Rocky Mountain National Park and used the model to compare different treatment options. Methods were evaulated with respect to the time required to reduce the population to a target level, the number of animals treated and/or culled and the risk of extinction. We contrasted culling with lifetime-effect contraceptives and yearlong contraceptives. Lifetime contraceptives required treating the fewest animals to maintain the population at desired targets. However, this approach also causes the greatest population variability and potential risk of extinction. Yearlong contraceptives required treatment of dramatically more animals but had essentially no extinction risk whereas culling produced intermediate levels of both extinction risk and number of animals treated. These results characterize the risks and benefits of alternative control strategies for overabundant wildlife. They emerge from a modeling approach that can be broadly useful in helping managers in choose between alternatives for regulating overabundant wildlife. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {We summarized the status of wolves (Canis lupus), elk (Cervis elaphus), and woody browse conditions during the 20th century for the upper Gallatin elk winter range in southwestern Montana, USA. During this period, wolves were present until about the mid-1920s, absent for seven decades, and then returned to the basin in 1996. A chronosequence of photographs, historical reports. and studies indicated willows (Salix spp.) along streams became heavily browsed and eventually suppressed following the removal of wolves, apparently due to unimpeded browsing by elk. However, after wolf establishment in 1996, browsing intensity on willows lessened in some areas and we hypothesized that, at both a landscape and fine scale, browsing pressure reflects terrain configurations influencing predation risk (nonlethal effects), in conjunction with lower elk densities (lethal effects). We measured browsing intensity and heights of Booth willow (S. boothii) along 3000 m reaches of the Gallatin River and a tributary to examine the potential influence of wolf/elk interactions upon willow growth. Where the Gallatin Valley is relatively narrow (high predation risk), willows began releasing in 1999 and by 2002 were relatively tall (150-250 cm). In contrast, willow heights along a wider portion of the Gallatin Valley, along the open landscape of the tributary, and an upland site (all low predation risk) generally remained low (<80 cm). We identified terrain and other features that may contribute to the perceived risk of wolf predation, by elk for a given site. Although alternative mechanisms are discussed, changes in willow communities over time following wolf removal and their subsequent reintroduction were consistent with a top-down trophic cascade model involving nonlethal and possibly lethal effects. If similar top-down effects upon vegetation hold true in other regions of North America and other parts of the world where wolves have been extirpated, wolf recovery may represent a management option for helping to restore riparian plant communities and conserve biodiversity.

However, for some purposes it is necessary to extrapolate from the number of family groups to obtain an estimate of total population size. Using data on survival and reproduction from radio-marked lynx from three Scandinavian study areas, we simulated the lynx population structure in February. The average proportions of family groups out of all independent individuals, i.e. adults and yearlings, in these simulations were 21% +/- 2.1 (SD), 22% +/- 3.6 and 27% +/- 3.1 for the data sets from northern Sweden (Sarek), southeastern Norway (Hedmark) and south-central Sweden (Bergslagen), respectively, and the overall mean for all three study areas was 23% +/- 3.8. This translated into extrapolation factors of 6.14 +/- 0.44, 6.24 +/- 0.73 and 5.48 +/- 0.40 for the three study areas, respectively, leading to an overall mean for all three study areas of 5.95 +/- 0.64.

	Abstract = {Populations of rare or elusive large mammals are difficult to monitor, because they usually are secretive, solitary, occur at low densities, and have large home ranges. The global trend of generally decreasing large carnivore populations necessitates new, feasible, reliable, and cost-effective monitoring methods. We evaluate an index method developed for monitoring populations of moose (Alces alces) based on voluntarily and systematically collected observations from hunters, corrected for effort, for use in monitoring populations of large carnivores in Sweden. For our evaluation, we used independent estimates of minimum brown bear (Ursus arctos) densities from DNA-based scat surveys and brown bear distribution from mandatory reports from successful bear hunters. We verified that the index correctly reflected bear distribution. We also found strong linear relationships between the indices and the independent density estimates for bears at the scale of local management units (about 1000-2000 km(2)) in all three regional study areas (adjusted R-2 = 0.88-0.60). Our results suggest that systematic, effort-corrected reports of observed animals can be an alternative and accurate monitoring method for the conservation and management of large mammals occurring over large areas when large numbers of willing volunteers are available (effort >30,000 h).

	Abstract = {Monitoring of lynx Lynx lynx populations in Scandinavia is largely based around unreplicated minimum counts of family groups, i.e. adult females with dependent kittens. When observations cannot be separated from each other on the basis of back-tracking in the snow it is desirable to use a distance rule to separate observations of groups that are so far apart that they are unlikely to be derived from the same group. We have analysed radio-telemetry derived movement data from five study areas, corresponding to three ecologically different regions, in Scandinavia, and included data from Poland for comparison. We derive examples of two different distance rules; one is a static rule based on home-range size and length which is suitable for observations accumulated during a whole winter, and the other is a dynamic rule suitable for observations collected within 1-7 days of each other. Because of inter-study area variation in home-range size and movement there is a need to use different rules in different regions. Within Scandinavia, average maximum home-range lengths varied from 28 to 54 km, and average maximum daily distances travelled varied from eight to 16 km in the three regions. This implies that locally collected movement data are a prerequisite for application of this type of methodology.},

	Abstract = {Calf losses are an acute issue in Fennoscandian reindeer Rangifer t. tarandus management. We studied calf mortality in northeastern Finnish Lapland using 621 calves (304 in 1997 and 317 in 1998) marked with silent mortality transmitters and followed their survival during 2 July 1997 - 31 January 1998 and during 22 June 1998 - 31 January 1999. In total, we found 43 dead calves and investigated their causes of death. A Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated 91.5% survival during July-January in both study years. However, differences in the temporal distribution of survival between the two study years were found. A minimum of 53% of total mortality was attributed to predation, with golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos being the main predator. Mortality caused by golden eagle comprised 2.8 and 4.2% during the study periods in 1997/98 and 1998/99, respectively. Body weight of the calves at midsummer (all weights adjusted on 2 July) was a significant predictor for survival, whereas sex and pelt colour were not. We conclude that predation is a major source of calf mortality during July-January, and that golden eagle predation was prominent, especially during midsummer and in open alpine landscapes.},

Although spatially explicit data on processes that generate ecological patterns, such as the distribution of disease over a landscape, are frequently unavailable, information about the scales over which processes operate can be used to understand the link between pattern and process. Our goal was to identify scales of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) movement and mixing that exerted the greatest influence on the spatial pattern of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in northcentral Colorado, USA. We hypothesized that three scales of mixing (individual, winter subpopulation, or summer subpopulation) might control spatial variation in disease prevalence. We developed a fully Bayesian hierarchical model to compare the strength of evidence for each mixing scale. We found strong evidence that the finest mixing scale corresponded best to the spatial distribution of CWD infection. There was also evidence that land ownership and habitat use play a role in exacerbating the disease, along with the known effects of sex and age. Our analysis demonstrates how information on the scales of spatial processes that generate observed patterns can be used to gain insight when process data are sparse or unavailable.},

Spatial correlation is often ignored in the selection of explanatory variables, and this can influence model selection results. For example, the importance of particular explanatory variables may not be apparent when spatial correlation is ignored. To address this problem, we consider the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as applied to a geostatistical model. We offer a heuristic derivation of the AIC in this context and provide simulation results that show that using AIC for a geostatistical model is superior to the often-used traditional approach of ignoring spatial correlation in the selection of explanatory variables. These ideas are further demonstrated via a model for lizard abundance. We also apply the principle of minimum description length (MDL) to variable selection for the geostatistical model. The effect of sampling design on the selection of explanatory covariates is also explored. R software to implement the geostatistical model selection methods described in this paper is available in the Supplement.},

These models included adjustments for density, an increase in the area of winter range used by elk, lagged effects of the weather covariates of spring precipitation, snow depth and winter temperature, and the impacts of the 1988 drought and fires. An information-criteria-based model-selection process strongly supported evidence of density dependence. The best model, a Ricker model, distinguished between the 2 time periods. The bulk of the difference between the 2 periods is attributed to an increase in the amount of winter range used by elk. Inclusion of the covariates spring precipitation and spring precipitation squared greatly improved the model fit. We detected a short-lived increase in elk population growth rate following the 1988 drought and fires. Fertility and survivorship of adults appeared to have different density-dependent forms that together result in a biphasic relationship between population growth rate and density. This study confirms the presence of density-dependent regulation in the northern Yellowstone elk herd, and enhances our understanding of population dynamics of these ungulates.},

	Abstract = {Big ecological changes often involve regime shifts in which a critical threshold is crossed. Thresholds are often difficult to measure, and transgressions of thresholds come as surprises. If a critical threshold is approached gradually, however, there are early warnings of the impending regime shift. For example, in a one-dimensional ecosystem dynamics, autocorrelation approaches 1 from below, variance and skewness increase, and variance spectra shift to lower frequencies. Here we focus on variance, an indicator easily computed from monitoring data. There are two distinct sources of increased variance near a critical threshold. One is the amplification of small shocks that occurs as the square of the modulus of the leading eigenvalue (or leading pair of eigenvalues in the complex case) approaches 1 from below. This source, called "squealing,'' is well-studied. The second source of variance, called "flickering,'' involves brief excursions between attractors. Interacting regime shifts may muffle or magnify variance near critical thresholds. Whether muffling or magnification occurs, and the size of the effect, depend on the product of the feedback between the state variables times the correlation of these variables' responses to environmental shocks. If this product is positive, magnification of the variance will occur. If the product is negative, muffling or magnification can occur depending on the relative magnitudes of these and other effects. Therefore, monitoring programs should measure variates that have opposite responses to the critical transition. If the correlations to environmental shocks have the same sign, the variance of at least one variate will be magnified as the critical transition is approached. Simulation studies suggest that muffling may sometimes interfere with detection of early warning signals of regime shifts. However, more important effects of muffling and magnification may come from their effect on flickering, when random shocks trigger a state change in a system with low resilience. Muffling decreases the likelihood that a random shock will trigger a regime shift. Magnification has the opposite effect. Magnification is most likely when feedbacks are positive and state variables have positively correlated responses to environmental shocks. These results help delimit the conditions when regime shifts are more likely to cascade through complex systems.},

	Abstract = {We evaluated the initial implications of wolf (Canis lupus) recovery on ungulates in Yellowstone National Park and compared expectations prior to wolf restoration with observed impacts since restoration. The numerical and functional responses of colonizing wolves in Yellowstone's prey-rich environment were higher than expected and close to the maximum rates predicted prior to wolf restoration. Counts of northern Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) decreased more (50%) than predicted (5-30%), and will likely continue to decrease given the strong preference of wolves for elk and continued high kill rates despite this substantial reduction in elk abundance. Contrary to expectations, human harvests were not reduced appreciably concurrent with wolf restoration, but instead remained similar to pre-wolf restoration years. However, antler-less permits were gradually reduced by 51% during 2000-2004 and additional reductions may be necessary while wolf densities remain high. There have been no substantial effects of wolf recovery on other ungulate species (bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), bison (Bison bison), moose (A Ices alces), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), pronghorn (Anti-loeapra americana)). However, wolf recovery may eventually contribute to increased bison and pronghorn abundance by decreasing elk and coyote abundance, respectively. Wolf recovery may also contribute to more-pronounced spatial structuring of sex/age classes of northern Yellowstone elk through changes in their distribution, migration, and age structure. The initial consequences of wolf recovery support the premise that wolves may naturally achieve densities above their threshold for ecological effectiveness and contribute to significant changes in ecosystems, including the amelioration of ungulate-caused landscape simplification.

	Abstract = {The interaction of large-scale fire, vegetation, and ungulates is an important management issue in Yellowstone National Park. A spatially explicit individual-based simulation model was developed to explore the effects of fire scale and pattern on the winter foraging dynamics and survival of free-ranging elk (Cervus elaphus) and bison (Bison bison) in northern Yellowstone National Park. The Northern Yellowstone Park (NOYELP) model simulates the search, movement, and foraging activities of individuals or small groups of elk 'and bison. The 77 020-ha landscape is represented as a gridded irregular polygon with a spatial resolution of 1 ha. Forage intake is a function of an animal's initial body mass, the absolute amount of forage available on a site, and the depth and density of snow. When the energy expenditures of an animal exceed the energy gained during a day, the animal's endogenous reserves are reduced to offset the deficits. Simulations are conducted with a 1-d time step for a duration of 180 d, almost-equal-to 1 November through the end of April. Simulated elk survival for three winters (1987-1988; 1988-1989; 1990-199 1) agreed with observed data. A factorial simulation experiment was conducted to explore the effects on ungulate survival of fire size, fire pattern, and winter severity during an initial postfire winter (when no forage is available in burned areas) and a later postfire winter (when forage is enhanced in burned areas). Initial ungulate population sizes were held constant at 18 000 elk and 600 bison. Winter severity played a dominant role in ungulate survival. When winter conditions were extremely mild, even fires that affected 60% of the landscape had no effect on ungulate-survival during the initial postfire winter. The effects of fire on ungulate survival become important when winter conditions were average to severe, and effects were apparent in both the initial and later postfire winters. The spatial patterning of fire influenced ungulate survival if fires covered small to moderate proportions of the landscape (e.g., 15% or 30%) and if winter snow conditions were moderate to severe. Ungulate survival was higher with a clumped than with a fragmented fire pattern, suggesting that a single, large fire is not equivalent to a group of smaller disconnected fires. The interaction between fire scale and spatial pattern suggests that knowledge of fire size alone is not always sufficient to predict ungulate survival.},

	Abstract = {Wolf (Canis lupus) impacts on prey are a central post-wolf-reintroduction issue in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem (CYE) of the western United States. Further, estimates of wolf kill rates, used to understand these impacts, can be biased due to unrecovered kills. In Yellowstone National Park (YNP), visibility of wolves allowed us to combine independent aerial and ground observations and use a double-count method to estimate the probability of recovering kills. We consequently used these data to adjust estimates of wolf kill rates. We conducted monitoring annually from 1995 to 2000 during 2 30-day periods in early (15 Nov-14 Dec) and late winter (Mar). Estimated recovery rates of wolf kills for ground and aerial crews were 50% and 45%, respectively, although we determined that this varied by location (distance from road) and possibly age (calf or adult) of the kill. The estimated combined recovery rate was 73%. Estimated wolf kill rates were higher in late winter (2.2 kills/wolf/month) compared to early winter (1.6 kills/wolf/month), with an overall estimated rate of 1.9 kills/wolf/month. The primary prey of wolves in winter was elk (Cervus elaphus; 90%). During our study, 43% of the elk killed were calves, 28% were adult females (cows), 21% were adult males (bulls), and 9% were of unknown age/sex. Comparing prey selection to prey availability, wolf packs residing on the northern range (NR) of the GYE selected for calves, against cows, and approximately proportional to availability for bulls. Prey use was different for wolf packs occupying the NR compared to packs residing in other areas (non-northern range [NNR]) and varied seasonally for NR packs. Variation in wolf kill rates by season, and the relative stability of the northern Yellowstone elk herd during a series of mild winters despite increases in wolf density, suggest that kill rates and ultimately elk population size are influenced by winter weather. Management of ungulates should reflect the addition of wolves combined with the unpredictability of winter weather in the mountainous terrain of the western United States.},

	Abstract = {We compare two approaches to designing and analyzing monitoring studies to assess chronic, local environmental impacts. Intervention Analysis (IA) compares Before and After time series at an Impact site; a special case is Before-After, Control-Impact (BACI), using comparison sites as covariates to reduce extraneous variance and serial correlation. IVRS (impact vs. reference sites) compares Impact and Control sites with respect to Before-After change, treating the sites as experimental units. The IVRS estimate of an "effect" is the same as that of the simplest BACI (though not of others), but IVRS estimates error variance by variation among sites, while IA and BACI estimate it by variation over time. These approaches differ in goals, design, and models of the role of chance in determining the data. In IA and BACI, the goal is to determine change at the specific Impact site, so no Controls are needed. IA does not have controls and BACI's are not experimental controls, but covariates, deliberately chosen to be correlated with the Impact site. The goal given for IVRS is to compare hypothetical Impact and Control "populations," so the Controls are essential and are randomly chosen, perhaps with restrictions to make them independent of each other and (presumably) of Impact. IA and BACI inferences are model based: uncertainty arises from sampling error and natural temporal processes causing variation in the variable of concern (e.g., a species' abundance); these processes are modeled as the results of repeatable chance setups. IVRS inferences are design based: uncertainty arises from variation among sites, as well as the other two sources, and is modeled by the assumed random selection of Impact and Control sites, like the drawing of equiprobable numbers from a hat. We outline the formal analyses, showing that IVRS is simpler, and BACI more complex, than usually supposed. We then describe the principles and assumptions of IA and BACI, defining an "effect" as the difference between what happened after the impact and what would have happened without it, and stressing the need to justify chance models as reasonable representations of human uncertainty. We respond to comments on BACI, some of which arise from misunderstanding of these principles. IVRS's design-based justification is almost always invalid in real assessments: the Impact site is not chosen randomly. We show that "as if random" selection by "Nature" is untenable and that an approximation to this, while a possibly useful guide, cannot be used for inference. We argue that, without literal random assignment of treatments to sites, IVRS can only be model based. Its design and analyses will then be different, using and allowing for correlation between sites. It is likely to have low power and requires strong assumptions that are difficult to check, so should be used only when IA or BACI cannot be used, e.g., when there are no Before data.},

	Abstract = {Wolf restoration has become a widely accepted conservation and management practice throughout North America and Europe, though the ecosystem effects of returning top carnivores remain both scientific and societal controversies. Mathematical models predicting and describing wolf ungulate interactions are typically limited to the wolves' primary prey, with the potential for prey switching in wolf-multiple-ungulate systems only suggested or assumed by a number of investigators. We used insights gained from experiments on small taxa and field data from ongoing wolf-ungulate studies to construct a model of predator diet composition for a wolf-elk-bison system in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. The model explicitly incorporates differential vulnerability of the ungulate prey types to predation, predator preference, differences in prey biomass, and the possibility of prey switching. Our model demonstrates wolf diet shifts with changes in relative abundance of the two prey, with the dynamics of this shift dependent on the combined influences of preference, differential vulnerability, relative abundances of prey, and whether or not switching occurs. Differences in vulnerability between elk and bison, and strong wolf preference for elk, result in an abrupt dietary shift occurring only when elk are very rare relative to bison, whereas incorporating switching initiates the dietary shift more gradually and at higher bison-elk ratios. We demonstrate how researchers can apply these equations in newly restored wolf-two-prey systems to empirically evaluate whether prey switching is occurring. Each coefficient in the model has a biological interpretation, and most can be directly estimated from empirical data collected from field studies. Given the potential for switching to dramatically influence predator-prey dynamics and the wide range of expected prey types and abundances in some systems where wolves are present and/or being restored, we suggest that this is an important and productive line of research that should be pursued by ecologists working in wolf-ungulate systems.},

	Abstract = {Emerging ecological time series from long-term ecological studies and remote sensing provide excellent opportunities for ecologists to study the dynamic patterns and governing processes of ecological systems. However, signal extraction from long-term time series often requires system learning (e.g., estimation of true system state) to process the large amount of information, to reconstruct system state, to account for measurement error, and to handle missing data. State-space models (SSMs) are a natural choice for these tasks and thus have received increasing attention in ecological and environmental studies. Data-based learning using SSMs that connect ecological processes to the measurement of system state becomes a useful technique in the ecological informatics toolkit. The present Study illustrates the use of the Kalman filter (KF), an estimator of SSMs, with case studies of population dynamics. The examples of the SSM applications include the reconstruction of system state using the KF method and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, estimation of measurement-error variances in the estimates of animal population abundance using basic structural models (BSMs), and estimation of missing values using the KF and Kalman smoother. Estimation of measurement-error variances by BSMs does not require knowledge of the functional form that generates the time series data. Instead, BSMs approximate the trajectory or deterministic skeleton of a system dynamics in a semi-parametric fashion, and provide a robust estimator of measurement-error variances. The present study also compares Bayesian SSMs with non-Bayesian SSMs. The joint use of the KF method or its extensions and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is a promising approach to the parameter estimation of SSMS.

	Abstract = {Recent research has shown how process variability and measurement error in ecological time series can be separated using state-space modeling techniques to combine individual-based data with population counts. We extend the current maximum likelihood approaches to allow the incorporation of sex-and age-dependent counts and provide an application to data from a population of Soay sheep living on the St. Kilda archipelago. We then empirically evaluate the performance and potential of the method by sequentially omitting portions of the data available. We show that the use of multivariate time series extends the power of the state-space modeling approach. The variance of measurement error was found to be smaller for males and the sex ratio of lambs to be skewed toward females and constant over time. Our results indicated that demographic parameters estimated using state-space modeling without relevant individual-based data were in close agreement with those obtained from mark-recapture-recovery analyses alone. Similarly, estimates of population size obtained when the corresponding count observations were unavailable were close to those from the entire data set. We conclude that the approach illustrated here has great potential for estimating hidden demographic parameters, planning studies on population monitoring, and estimating both historical and future population size.},

	Abstract = {Ungulate winter grazing was simulated on simple random and actual landscape patterns using an individual-based modeling approach to explore the effect of landscape heterogeneity on foraging dynamics. The landscape was represented as a 100 times 100 grid with each cell considered to be either a resource or nonresource site. Random maps were generated by specifying the proportion, p, of the landscape occupied by resource sites. Actual landscape maps were obtained from the spatial arrangement of sagebrush-grassland habitats in subsections of northern Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. Each resource site was assigned an initial forage abundance, and a specified number of ungulates were distributed randomly across the landscape on resource sites.  . Daily energy balances were computed for each ungulate by subtracting energy cost from energy gain, and ungulates were assumed to die when they reached 70% of their lean body weight. Simulation results suggested that when resources were abundant across the landscape (i.e., high p), the search-and-movement rule selected to simulate foraging was not important. That is, a variety of strategies should suffice under high-resource conditions, and there was no benefit to having a more efficient rule. However, when resources were scarce (e.g., low p or high ungulate densities), then the ability to discern resource abundances and to move over greater distances resulted in lower mortality. For a given p, the difference between a fragmented (i.e., random) and aggregated (i.e., real) arrangement of resource sites was only pronounced when the ability of the animals to move was very limited. In these situations, survival was always greater in the real landscapes. Individual-based spatial models developed for specific landscapes and species could be quite valuable in enhancing our understanding of landscape dynamics and large herbivores.},

Key elements of this process are objectives, alternative management actions, models permitting prediction of system responses, and a monitoring program. The iterative process produces optimal management decisions and leads to reduction in uncertainty about response of populations to management. This general approach to management has a number of desirable features and is recommended for use in many other programs of management and conservation.},

	Abstract = {Frequentist statistics is not well adapted to handling uncertainties inherent in managing natural resources. A frequentist approach typically involves estimating unknown parameters of ecosystem relationships and testing their statistical significance. While such information is useful, natural resource managers have a greater need to know the most likely current state of an ecosystem and whether particular management actions improve that state in cases where it is not sustainable. Bayesian inference overcomes many of the deficiencies of frequentist statistics and is particularly well suited for implementing adaptive management (AM). Passive and active AM are distinguished and a Bayesian approach to active AM in static and dynamic settings is described for a hypothetical decision problem. The problem is deciding whether or not imposing restrictions on road density and use (referred to as road policy) in northwest Montana's Flathead National Forest improves habitat for the threatened grizzly bear. The proposed Bayesian approach to this decision problem specifies competing hypotheses about the effects of road policy on habitat suitability and evaluates those hypotheses using Bayes theorem and Bayes action.

Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) can serve many purposes, from illustrating a conceptual understanding of system relations to calculating joint probabilities for decision options and predicting outcomes of management policies. We describe the nature and capabilities of BBNs, discuss their applications to the adaptive-management process, and present a case example of adaptive management of forests and terrestrial lichens in north-central British Columbia. We recommend that those unfamiliar with BBNs should begin by first developing influence diagrams with relatively simple structures that represent the system under management. Such basic models can then be elaborated to include more variables, the mathematical relations among them, and features that allow assessment of the utility of alternative management actions or strategies. Users of BBNs should be aware of several important limitations, including problems in representing feedback and time-dynamic functions. Nevertheless, when properly used, Bayesian networks can benefit most adaptive-management teams by promoting a shared understanding of the system being managed and encouraging the rigorous examination of alternative management policies.},

This problem has been traditionally analyzed using frequentist estimation of parameters with confidence intervals or frequentist hypothesis testing. Bayesian statistical analysis provides an alternative approach that has many advantages. It has a more intuitive interpretation, providing probability assessments of parameters. It provides the Bayesian logic of "if (data), then probability (parameters)" rather than the frequentist logic of "if (parameters), then probability (data)." It provides a sequential; cumulative, scientific approach to analysis; using prior information and reassessing the probability distribution of parameters for adaptive management decision making. It has been integrated with decision theory and provides estimates of risk. Natural resource scientists have the opportunity of using Bayesian statistical analysis to their advantage now that this alternative approach to statistical inference has become practical and accessible.},

	Abstract = {Population sample data are complex; inference and prediction require proper accommodation of not only the nonlinear interactions that determine the expected future abundance, but also the stochasticity inherent in data and variable (often unobserved) environmental factors. Moreover, censuses may occur sporadically, and observation errors change with sample methods and effort. The state variable (usually density or abundance) may be hidden from view and known only through highly indirect observational schemes (such as public health records, hunting reports, or fossil/archeological surveys). We extend the basic state-space model for time-series analysis to accommodate these dominant sources of variability that influence population data. Using examples, we show how different types of process error and observation error, unequal sample intervals, and missing values can be accounted for within the flexible framework of Bayesian state-space models. We provide algorithms based on Gibbs sampling that can be used to obtain posterior estimates of population states and of model parameters. For models that can be linearized, results can be used for direct sampling of the posterior, including those with missing values and unequal sample intervals. For nonlinear models, we make use of Metropolis-Hastings within the Gibbs sampling framework. Examples derive from long-term census and population data. We illustrate the extension to discrete state variables with multiple stages using a Time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (TSIR) model for mid 20th-century measles infection in London, where birth rates are assumed known, but susceptibles and infected individuals arise from imperfect reporting.},

Process variation, which can be both demographic and environmental, is modeled by linking a series of stochastic and deterministic subprocesses that characterize processes such as birth, survival, maturation, and movement. Observations of the population can be modeled as functions of true abundance with realistic probability distributions to describe observation or estimation error. Computer-intensive procedures, such as sequential Monte Carlo methods or Markov chain Monte Carlo, condition on the observed data to yield estimates of both the underlying true population abundances and the unknown population dynamics parameters. Formulation and fitting of a hidden process model are demonstrated for Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytsha).},

	Abstract = {Analyses of ecological data should account for the uncertainty in the process(es) that generated the data. However, accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult task, since ecology is known for its complexity. Measurement and/or process errors are often the only sources of uncertainty modeled when addressing complex ecological problems, yet analyses should also account for uncertainty in sampling design, in model specification, in parameters governing the specified model, and in initial and boundary conditions. Only then can we be con. dent in the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is not new in ecology, and there are many examples ( both Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for discussion and tried to show where the practical difficulties lie. Our thesis is that hierarchical statistical modeling is a powerful way of approaching ecological analysis in the presence of inevitable but quanti. able uncertainties, even if practical issues sometimes require pragmatic compromises.},

	Abstract = {Advances in computational statistics provide a general framework for the high-dimensional models typically needed for ecological inference and prediction. Hierarchical Bayes (HB) represents a modelling structure with capacity to exploit diverse sources of information, to accommodate influences that are unknown (or unknowable), and to draw inference on large numbers of latent variables and parameters that describe complex relationships. Here I summarize the structure of HB and provide examples for common spatiotemporal problems. The flexible framework means that parameters, variables and latent variables can represent broader classes of model elements than are treated in traditional models. Inference and prediction depend on two types of stochasticity, including (1) uncertainty, which describes our knowledge of fixed quantities, it applies to all 'unobservables' (latent variables and parameters), and it declines asymptotically with sample size, and (2) variability, which applies to fluctuations that are not explained by deterministic processes and does not decline asymptotically with sample size. Examples demonstrate how different sources of stochasticity impact inference and prediction and how allowance for stochastic influences can guide research.},

Data analysts typically select a model from some class of models and then proceed as if the selected model had generated the data. This approach ignores the uncertainty in model selection, leading to over-confident inferences and decisions that are more risky than one thinks they are.

We discuss these methods and present a number of examples. In these examples, BMA provides improved out-of-sample predictive performance.

	Abstract = {In ecology textbooks prior to the 1970s, Aldo Leopold's classic story of predator control, overpopulation of deer, and habitat degradation on the Kaibab Plateau during the 1920s epitomized predator regulation of herbivore populations. However, the story disappeared from texts in the late 20th century after several papers noted uncertainties in estimations of the deer population and provided alternative explanations. We re-examined the case study by determining the age structure of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) on the plateau. Aspen comprises the majority of deer browse in the summer, and the absence of a normal cohort of aspen from the 1920s would indicate deer overpopulation. The number of aspen (at 1.4 m) dating to the 1920s was an order of magnitude lower than the null expectation. Other periods of unusual numbers of aspen included high numbers of aspen dating to the 1880s and 1890s (when regular surface fires ceased), few aspen dating from 1953 to 1962 (after a second irruption of the deer population), and very high numbers from 1968 to 1992 (coincident with widespread logging). These convergent lines of evidence support the idea of extreme deer herbivory in the 1920s, consistent with food limitation of deer at high populations (bottom-up control) and predation limitation at low deer populations (top-down control). Some uncertainty remains within the overall story, and this level of ambiguity is common in case studies that involve population ecology, land management, and people at the scale of 1,000 km(2) and 100 years. A complete version of the Kaibab deer story and its history would be a valuable, realistic case study for ecology texts.},

	Abstract = {We analyzed counts of northern Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA, over 70 years to evaluate the effects of changing management on population trends. Population reduction efforts and hunter harvests during 1932-1968 removed 71,330 elk and decreased estimated abundance from 16,000 to 6,000 elk. Abundance increased to approximately 17,000 elk (lambda = 1.19) when removals ceased and harvests were very small during 1969-1975. Moderate to liberal hunter harvests of antlerless elk outside the Park during 1976-2004 removed a relatively consistent proportion (26 +/- 0.1 [SD]%) of females that migrated outside the park, mostly from prime-age (3-15 yr) classes with high reproductive value. Substantial winterkill was infrequent (1989, 1997), but it significantly reduced calf survival when it occurred. Wolves (Canis lupus) were reintroduced in 1995-1996 and rapidly increased in abundance (lambda = 1.23) and distribution. Estimated wolfkill of elk now exceeds hunter harvest, but has a smaller effect on population dynamics because wolves concentrate on calves and older females (>14 yr) with low reproductive value. During 1995-2004, estimated abundance decreased from 23,000 to 12,000 elk. The recent ratio of wolves to elk is relatively low compared to the estimated equilibrium ratio, suggesting that the wolf population may yet increase in the future. Thus, reduction of harvests of prime-aged female elk to decrease removals of animals with high reproductive value and increase adult female survival appears essential. We analyzed the relative impact of removals by hunters and by wolves using Fisher's (1930) reproductive value and found that the impact of hunters is far more important than that by wolves, a finding of broad significance.},

	Abstract = {A snowpack simulation model was developed for high-resolution spatial prediction of wildlife habitat over large areas (100-1000 km). The model simulates a single layer water and energy balance, based on the Utah Energy Balance (UEB) model. It is driven by daily precipitation and temperature data, and 28.5-m maps of mean annual precipitation, terrain, vegetation, and geothermal heat flux. Parameters were calibrated against daily snow water equivalent (SWE) data at SNOTEL sites. The model was tested against spatial SWE data collected throughout the landscape, as well as snowpack temperature data, and photographic data. Spatial SWE data were supplied as a set of 40 high-accuracy means for different landscape strata, based on 1058 snow cores. At the time of peak snowpack accumulation in 2002, differences between modeled and measured SWE at the pixel scale were apportioned into three potential components: field sampling error (similar to 22%), parameter mapping error (similar to 27%), and actual model functional error (similar to 51 %). Since the present study controlled for sampling and mapping error, clear priorities could be identified for reducing model functional error, including improvement of sub-models for snow interception, and snowpack thermal dynamics. The utility and detectability of improvements along these lines is contingent on controlling and quantifying both sampling and mapping error. The model strikes a unique balance between physical detail and spatial resolution and extent that is well suited for use in wildlife studies. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Snow was sampled across a heterogeneous landscape within 40 strata defined by time, elevation, vegetation, and solar radiation (i.e. terrain). The objective was to efficiently develop accurate estimates of the mean snowpack properties of each stratum, for later use in testing the accuracy of a snowpack simulation model. Sources of variance were assumed to be 'fixed' (i.e. predictable) or 'random' (i.e. unpredictable). A nested sampling design was used to minimize random effects relative to sampling cost, and theoretically shown to be optimal or near optimal. Within the strata that were sampled, time and elevation effects on snow water equivalent (SWE) were greater than random effects, but random effects were greater than vegetation and radiation effects. Random effects were greatest at small scales (< 100 m). The results indicated that because of this large variance at small scales, seasonal snowpacks must be sampled very intensely (up to 54 cores per estimated mean) in order to yield confidence intervals for the mean that are narrow enough to determine vegetation and radiation effects on SWE; and thus also, to enable meaningful comparisons between models and data with respect to vegetation and radiation effects. The resulting data have low sampling variance, and thus are ideally suited for testing of snowpack simulation models. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Long distance migrations by ungulate species often surpass the boundaries of preservation areas where conflicts with various publics lead to management actions that can threaten populations. We chose the partially migratory bison ( Bison bison) population in Yellowstone National Park as an example of integrating science into management policies to better conserve migratory ungulates. Approximately 60% of these bison have been exposed to bovine brucellosis and thousands of migrants exiting the park boundary have been culled during the past two decades to reduce the risk of disease transmission to cattle. Data were assimilated using models representing competing hypotheses of bison migration during 1990-2009 in a hierarchal Bayesian framework. Migration differed at the scale of herds, but a single unifying logistic model was useful for predicting migrations by both herds. Migration beyond the northern park boundary was affected by herd size, accumulated snow water equivalent, and aboveground dried biomass. Migration beyond the western park boundary was less influenced by these predictors and process model performance suggested an important control on recent migrations was excluded. Simulations of migrations over the next decade suggest that allowing increased numbers of bison beyond park boundaries during severe climate conditions may be the only means of avoiding episodic, large-scale reductions to the Yellowstone bison population in the foreseeable future. This research is an example of how long distance migration dynamics can be incorporated into improved management policies.},

	Abstract = {The influence of winter recreation on wildlife in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), Wyoming and Montana, USA, is a controversial issue. In particular, the effects of road grooming, done to facilitate snowmobile and snowcoach travel, on bison (Bison bison) ecology are under debate. We collected data during winters, from 1997 to 2005, on bison road use, off-road travel, and activity budgets to quantify temporal trends in the amount of bison road and off-road travel and to identify the ecological factors affecting bison movements and use of the groomed road system in the Madison-Gibbon-Firchole (MGF) area of YNP. Using model comparison techniques, we found bison travel patterns to be influenced by multiple, interacting effects. Road travel was negatively correlated with road grooming, and we found no evidence that bison preferentially, used groomed roads during winter. Snow water equivalent, bison density, and the springtime melt period were positively correlated with both bison road and off-road travel. From behavioral scans on 68 791 bison, we found that travel is only a small percentage (11%) of all bison activity, with foraging comprising 67% of observations. Also, only 7% of traveling bison and 30% of foraging bison were displacing snow, and we suggest foraging, rather than traveling, is likely the major energetic cost to bison in winter. Bison utilize their. own trail network, connecting foraging areas using stream corridors, geothermal pathways, and self-groomed travel routes. Our results indicate that temporal patterns in bison road travel are a manifestation of general travel behavior and that groomed roads in the MGF do not appear to be a major factor influencing bison ecology and spatial redistribution. We suggest that the changes in bison spatial dynamics during, the past three decades have likely been the result-of the-natural phenomenon of density-dependent range expansioh, rather than having been caused by the anthropogenic influence of road grooming.},

	Abstract = {Reintroduction of wolves (Cams lupus) to Yellowstone National Park in 19951996 has been argued to promote a trophic cascade by altering elk (Cervus elaphus) density, habitat-selection patterns, and behavior that, in turn, could lead to changes within the plant communities used by elk. We sampled two species of willow (Salix boothii and S. geveriana) on the northern winter range to determine whether (1) there was quantitative evidence of increased willow growth following wolf reintroduction, (2) browsing by elk affected willow growth, and (3) any increase in growth observed was greater than that expected by climatic and hydrological factors alone, thereby indicating a trophic cascade caused by wolves. Using stem sectioning techniques to quantify historical growth patterns we found an approximately twofold increase in stem growth-ring area following wolf reintroduction for both species of willow. This increase could not be explained by climate and hydrological factors alone; the presence of wolves on the landscape was a significant predictor of stem growth above and beyond these abiotic factors. Growth-ring area was positively correlated with the previous year's ring area and negatively correlated with the percentage of twigs browsed from the stem during the winter preceding growth, indicating that elk browse impeded stem growth. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis of a behaviorally mediated trophic cascade on Yellowstone's northern winter range following wolf reintroduction. We suggest that the community-altering effects of wolf restoration are an endorsement of ecological-process management in Yellowstone National Park.},

	Abstract = {{Fine root processes play a prominent role in the carbon and nutrient
   cycling of boreal ecosystems due to the high proportion of biomass
   allocated belowground and the rapid decomposition of fine roots
   relative to aboveground tissues. To examine these issues in detail,
   major components of ecosystem carbon flux were studied in three mature
   black spruce forests in interior Alaska, where fine root production,
   respiration, mortality and decomposition, and aboveground production of
   trees, shrubs, and mosses were measured relative to soil CO2 fluxes.
   Fine root production, measured over a two-year period using
   minirhizotrons, varied from 0.004 +/- 0.001 mm.cm(-2).d(-1) over
   winter, to 0.051 +/- 0.015 mm.cm(-2).d(-1) during July, with peak
   growing season values comparable to those reported for many temperate
   forests using similar methods. On average, 84\% of this production
   occurred Within 20 cm of the moss surface, although the proportion
   occurring in deeper profiles increased as soils gradually warmed
   throughout the summer. Monthly rates of production and mortality were
   somewhat asynchronous because mortality tended to peak during fall and
   be minimal during periods of peak production. Production and mortality
   were, however, positively correlated across all tubes and lime periods.
   Annual fine root production averaged 2.45 +/- 0.31, 8.01 +/- 1.39, and
   2.53 +/- 0.27 mm.cm(-2).yr(-1) (means +/- 1 SE) among the three sites,
   when averaged across years. Fine root survival and decomposition were
   measured by tracking and analyzing the fate of individual fine roots
   using mark-recapture techniques.
   Fine root survival was greatest during periods of peak root growth, and
   least over winter (phi(time)). Roots first appearing in the middle of
   the growing season had higher survival rates than those first appearing
   early or late in the growing season, or over winter (phi(cohort)) and
   risk of mortality decreased With root age (phi(age)). Survival
   estimates translate to mean life spans of 108 +/- 4.d during the
   growing, season. While these values are in striking contrast to needle
   longevity and rates of aboveground litter decomposition, they are
   similar to many values found for temperate systems, supporting the
   notion.-that there are basic morphological and physiological traits of
   first-order roots that are common to most woody plant root systems.
   During the growing season, monthly fine root decomposition rates
   averaged 0.46 +/- 0.01 per month, while decomposition rates over winter
   averaged 0.73 +/- 0.01 per winter. These growing season estimates
   translate to 49 +/- 2 d from the time a root was first observed as
   dead, to the time it disappeared. For roots that decomposed during the
   growing season, those with longer life spans decomposed more slowly
   after death. Comparing these results with other minirhizotron studies
   suggests that life-history traits of black spruce first-order roots are
   similar to those from temperate (and perhaps most) forest ecosystems.
   Annual production of fine roots averaged 228 +/- 75 g
   biomass.m(-2).yr(-1), constituting similar to56\% of total stand
   production. Aboveground production of trees (50 +/- 14 g
   biomass.m(-2).yr(-1), 13\%) and shrubs (40 +/- 2 g
   biomass-m(-2).yr(-1), 11\%) contributed similarly to total production,
   while mosses (73 +/- 14 g biomass.m(-2).yr(-1), 20\%) accounted for the
   largest component of aboveground production. Soil temperature had a
   strong control over both soil respiration (Q(10) = 2.21 +/- 0.31) and
   root respiration (Q(10) = 2.30 +/- 0.37). During the growing season (15
   May to 15 September), similar to56\% of soil CO2 efflux (580 +/- 40 g
   C/m(2)) was-derived from fine root respiration (329 +/- 54 g C/m(2)).
   Although apparent rates of heterotrophic respiration (May through
   September) and total production did licit-differ, definitive estimates
   of net ecosystem production are impossible given the potentially large,
   unmeasured components of NPP (net primary production), such as root
   exudation and mycorrhizal production. Nevertheless, rates of fine root
   production, mortality, and decomposition indicate that in these black
   spruce ecosystems, fine roots are much more dynamic than would be
   predicted from patterns of aboveground processes, and that carbon, and
   presumably nutrients, are cycling through fine roots at rates several
   orders of magnitude faster than through aboveground tissues.}},

	Abstract = {Large vertebrates are strong interactors in food webs, yet they were lost from most ecosystems after the dispersal of modern humans from Africa and Eurasia. We call for restoration of missing ecological functions and evolutionary potential of lost North American megafauna using extant conspecifics and related taxa. We refer to this restoration as Pleistocene rewilding; it is conceived as carefully managed ecosystem manipulations whereby costs and benefits are objectively addressed on a case-by-case and locality-by-locality basis. Pleistocene rewilding would deliberately promote large, long-lived species over pest and weed assemblages, facilitate the persistence and ecological effectiveness of megafauna on a global scale, and broaden the underlying premise of conservation from managing extinction to encompass restoring ecological and evolutionary processes. Pleistocene rewilding can begin immediately with species such as Bolson tortoises and feral horses and continue through the coming decades with elephants and Holarctic lions. Our exemplar taxa would contribute biological, economic, and cultural benefits to North America. Owners of large tracts of private land in the central and western United States could be the first to implement this restoration. Risks of Pleistocene rewilding include the possibility of altered disease ecology and associated human health implications, as well as unexpected ecological and sociopolitical consequences of reintroductions. Establishment of programs to monitor suites of species interactions and their consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem health will be a significant challenge. Secure fencing would be a major economic cost, and social challenges will include acceptance of predation as an overriding natural process and the incorporation of pre-Columbian ecological frameworks into conservation strategies.},

For example, endangered species laws and regulations and other conservation statutes typically fail to consider the interactions of strongly interacting species, probably because the importance of such interactions was not well understood when the laws were drafted. By failing to consider current knowledge, therefore, natural resource scientists and managers may be harming the species and systems they are charged with protecting. Most ecologists agree that the conservation of biodiversity is facilitated by maintaining population densities and distributions of strongly interactive species above estimable thresholds for ecological effectiveness. Assuming that conservation biologists and natural resource managers are "physicians to nature," we therefore propose they are obligated to adhere to a doctrine of "best conservation practices based on the best science," applying a more rigorous standard for the management of relatively interactive species than may be mandated by older statutes and effected by current practice and convention.},

	Abstract = {Natural regulation of native ungulates was initiated in 1968 in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) based on the premise that ungulates would reach an equilibrium with their plant resources. The natural-regulation management model stated: density dependence wilt regulate ungulates (i.e., a dynamic equilibrium will result between ungulates and their food supply, within some bounds of vegetation and soil effects); and no retrogression of soil and vegetation will occur from elk (Cervus elaphus) grazing during this process. The historical record indicated that elk were abundant in the system and elk were primarily food limited before settlement by European man (i.e., wolves [Canis lupus] and Native Americans were only an adjunct to the density dependent population regulation of ungulates). Density dependence was demonstrated in elk, but not in bison (Bison bison). No widespread evidence of overgrazing was observed through 1993 in study sites within vegetation communities that comprised about 97% of the winter range. No evidence of increased exotics, increased sediment yield, warming or drying of the soil, changes in soil nutrients, or differences in aboveground standing-crop biomass of plants was found between grazed and ungrazed plots. Ungulate herbivory apparently stimulated aboveground production of grasses, enhanced nitrogen and macronutrients in grasses, increased nutrient cycling, and enhanced measures of fitness in 6 common plants. However, exposed soil surface (bare ground and pebbles combined) was 11-18% greater on grazed than ungrazed plots, apparently due to a 71% decline in dead and standing litter on grazed plots. Percent live-plant basal cover, however, did not differ on grazed versus ungrazed plots, and there was no difference in soil microclimate or sediment yield. Differences in the abundance of 12% of the herbaceous species were found in grazed versus ungrazed sites (16 of 128 species); 10 were declines and 6 were increases. Willow (Salix spp.) and aspen (Populus tremuloides) declines predated the new management policy, but their slow declines also continued after 1968. Three uncommon plant species (aspen, willow, and Wyoming big sagebrush [Artemisia tridentata tridentata]) and 1 herbivore(moose [Alces alces]) declined under natural- regulation management. Two uncommon species of woody browse (aspen, Wyoming big sagebrush) were overutilized by ungulates (consumption of >2/3 current annual growth occurred). We conclude the natural-regulation model for YNP was flawed in its assumptions of a single, steady state for the park, based on conditions presumed to exist in 1870 prior to establishment of the national park. The period selected as a standard (1870) was an unusual period characterized by frequent large fires and floods, common wolves, few elk, and a cooler, wetter climate. We also conclude there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding what elk densities were in pre-Columbian times (element 3 of the management model) and what effects wolves and Native Americans had in regulating the elk population.},

	Abstract = {There is increasing interest in developing better predictive tools and a broader conceptual framework to guide the restoration of degraded land. Traditionally, restoration efforts have focused on re-establishing historical disturbance regimes or abiotic conditions, relying on successional processes to guide the recovery of biotic communities. However, strong feedbacks between biotic factors and the physical environment can alter the efficacy of these successional-based management efforts. Recent experimental work indicates that some degraded systems are resilient to traditional restoration efforts owing to constraints such as changes in landscape connectivity and organization, loss of native species pools, shifts in species dominance, trophic interactions and/or invasion by exotics, and concomitant effects on biogeochemical processes. Models of alternative ecosystem states that incorporate system thresholds and feedbacks are now being applied to the dynamics of recovery in degraded systems and are suggesting ways in which restoration can identify, prioritize and address these constraints.},

Our review of the literature revealed at least 3 mechanisms whereby deer can create such states. We present an example of an apparent alternate stable state created by deer, as well as several examples of suppressed forest regeneration that may be precursors to such a state. Evidence suggests that deer may create alternate stable states in woody plant communities of the eastern United States.

	Abstract = {Populations of beaver and willow have not thrived in riparian environments that are heavily browsed by livestock or ungulates, such as elk. The interaction of beaver and elk herbivory may be an important mechanism underlying beaver and willow declines in this competitive environment. We conducted a field experiment that compared the standing crop of willow three years after simulated beaver cutting on paired plants with and without intense elk browsing (similar to85% utilization rate). Simulated beaver cutting with intense elk browsing produced willow that was small (biomass and diameter) and short, with far fewer, but longer, shoots and a higher percentage of dead biomass. In contrast, simulated beaver cutting without elk browsing produced willow that was large, tall, and leafy, with many more, but shorter, shoots (highly branched) and a lower percentage of dead biomass. Total stem biomass after three years was 10 times greater on unbrowsed plants than on browsed plants. Unbrowsed plants recovered 84% of their pre-cut biomass after only two growing seasons, whereas browsed plants recovered only 6%. Thus, the interaction of beaver cutting and elk browsing strongly suppressed the standing crop of willow. We predict that a lack of willow suitable as winter food for beaver can cause beaver populations to decline, creating a feedback mechanism that reduces beaver and willow populations. Thus, intense herbivory by ungulates or livestock can disrupt beaver-willow mutualisms that naturally occur in less competitive environments.},

Average browsing intensities (n = 3 stream reaches) of 100% in 1997 decreased to 0%-55% by 2003, whereas average stem heights of 25-74 cm in 1997 increased to 149-268 cm by 2003, indicating that willow height growth was inversely related to browsing intensity In addition, average willow canopy cover over the streams increased from <5% in 1997 to 14%-73% in 2004.

	Abstract = {Large predators potentially can help shape the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, yet strong evidence of top-down herbivore limitation has not been widely reported in the scientific literature. Herein we synthesize outcomes of recent tri-trophic cascades studies involving the presence and absence of large predators for five national parks in the western United States, including Olympic, Yosemite, Yellowstone, Zion, and Wind Cave. Historical observations by park biologists regarding woody browse species and recently compiled age structure data for deciduous trees indicate major impacts to woody plant communities by ungulates following the extirpation or displacement of large predators. Declines in long-term tree recruitment indexed additional effects to plant communities and ecological processes, as well as shifts towards alternative ecosystem states. The magnitude and consistency of vegetation impacts found within these five parks, in conjunction with other recent North American studies, indicate that broad changes to ecosystem processes and the lower trophic level may have occurred in other parts of the western United States where large predators have been extirpated or displaced. Thus, where ungulates have significantly altered native plant communities in the absence of large predators, restoration of native flora is urgently needed to recover former ecosystem services. Following the reintroduction of previously extirpated gray wolves Canis lupus into Yellowstone National Park, a spatially patchy recovery of woody browse species (e.g., aspen Populus tremuloides, willow Salix spp., cottonwood Populus spp.) has begun, indicating that large predator recovery may represent an important restoration strategy for ecosystems degraded by wild ungulates.

	Abstract = {Gray wolves (Canis lupus) were extirpated from Yellowstone National Park in the 1920s. The ensuing seven decades marked a period when wild ungulates, principally Elk (Cervus elaphus), extensively used woody browse species in the upper Gallatin and northern winter ranges, thus limiting the capability of establishing plants to grow more than 100 cm in height. Following the reintroduction of wolves in the mid-1990s, we evaluated patterns of woody browse species recovery within riparian areas of these winter ranges. Measurements indicated that cottonwood (Populus spp.) recruitment (growth of seedlings/sprouts into tall saplings and trees) was occurring for the first time in several decades. A spatially patchy increase in the heights of young willow (Salix sp.) and cottonwood in the upper Gallatin and northern winter ranges, respectively, was also found within riparian transects comprising nearly 20 km in total length. Within some transects, heights of woody species have begun to exceed 200 cm (the approximate upper browse level of Elk). Results are consistent with the reestablishment of a tri-level trophic cascade involving wolves, ungulates, and riparian vegetation. We additionally present conceptual models of vegetation recovery, illustrating differences in plant height responses to behaviorally and density-mediated trophic cascades. Northern Yellowstone's "experiment in time," whereby wolves were removed and then reintroduced, provides new insights regarding how top predators can influence the structure and biodiversity of terrestrial ecosystems. Restoration ecologists and policymakers should consider the potential benefits of large predators as an option for helping restore degraded ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {Excessive levels of herbivory may disturb ecosystems in ways that persist even when herbivory is moderated. These persistent changes may complicate efforts to restore ecosystems affected by herbivores. Willow (Salix spp.) communities within the northern range in Yellowstone National Park have been eliminated or degraded in many riparian areas by excessive elk (Cervus elaphus L.) browsing. Elk browsing of riparian willows appears to have diminished following the reintroduction of wolves (Canis lupis L.), but it remains uncertain whether reduced herbivory will restore willow communities. The direct effects of elk browsing on willows have been accompanied by indirect effects from the loss of beaver (Castor canadensis Kuhl) activity, including incision of stream channels, erosion of fine sediments, and lower water tables near streams historically dammed by beaver. In areas where these changes' have occurred, lowered water tables may suppress willow height even in the absence of elk browsing. We conducted a factorial field experiment to understand willow responses to browsing and to height of water tables. After four years of protection from elk browsing, willows with ambient water tables averaged only 106 cm in height, with negligible height gain in two of three study species during the last year of the experiment. Willows that were protected from browsing and had artificially elevated water tables averaged 147 cm in height and gained 19 cm in the last year of the experiment. In browsed plots, elevated water tables doubled height gain during a period of slightly reduced browsing pressure. We conclude that water availability mediates the rate of willow height gain and may determine whether willows grow tall enough to escape the browse zone of elk and gain resistance to future elk browsing. Consequently, in areas where long-term beaver absence has resulted in incised stream channels and low water tables, a reduction in elk browsing alone may not be sufficient for recovery of tall willow stands. Because tall willow stems are important elements of habitat for beaver, mitigating water table decline may be necessary in these areas to promote recovery of historical willow-beaver mutualisms.},

	Abstract = {Spatiotemporal variation in primary productivity is known to have strong and far-reaching effects on herbivore ecology, but this relationship is often studied indirectly at broad scales, in part due to the difficulty in measuring selection for green biomass by individual animals. In aquatic systems, the concentration of chlorophyll in herbivore feces has been used as a direct measure of the consumption of photosynthetic primary production, but this method has not been applied to terrestrial systems. We measured chlorophyll concentration in feces from elk (Cervus elaphus) experiencing large fluctuations in primary production in the winter to spring transition over three years. We compared temporal trends in fecal chlorophyll with trends in fecal nitrogen, grass chlorophyll, grass digestible nitrogen, and landscape-level primary productivity (as described by the normalized difference vegetation index or NDVI). We also directly examined the relationship between fecal chlorophyll and NDVI. Temporal trends in fecal chlorophyll were strong and well described by piecewise regression (adjusted coefficient of determination, r(a)(2) = 0.881-0.888), showing uniformly low concentrations throughout winter followed by an abrupt, rapid increase beginning on different Julian days (88, 91, or 110) each year. Changes in fecal chlorophyll closely matched the temporal trend in the chlorophyll and digestible nitrogen concentration of forage grasses collected directly from elk feeding sites. Fecal chlorophyll also tracked broad temporal patterns in fecal nitrogen and NDVI, but discrepancies between the indexes may highlight preferences or constraints on selectivity for green biomass in elk. Spatially and temporally matched NDVI and fecal chlorophyll estimates were uncorrelated until NDVI reached approximately half its seasonal range. Combined, these data describe important patterns in selection for nutritious, green biomass in a temperate herbivore that would be difficult to study without data on fecal chlorophyll. Fecal chlorophyll produced novel and precise descriptions of (and detected large interannual differences in) winter length, severity, and the rate of spring green-up, as they were experienced by a large, grazing herbivore. Measuring fecal chlorophyll provides a noninvasive, inexpensive, and direct approach to describe an important aspect of foraging ecology in terrestrial herbivores and may be particularly powerful for studying climate effects in seasonal environments.},

	Abstract = {Much of the research into herbivore ecology and evolution has focused on patterns and mechanisms of niche partitioning in the diets of specialized grazers and browsers, but the significance of the balance of grazing and browsing within intermediate feeders present unique questions that have received less attention. We explored the nutritional effects of varying the balance of grass and browse in the winter diets of elk (Cervus elaphus). We compiled published data from three similar studies that monitored the mass dynamics of captive elk fed diets of pure grass, pure browse or 1 of 14 mixed diets in winter feeding trials. Elk lost mass (up to 22% of initial body weight) in 29 of 33 feeding trials, similar to wild elk in winter. We used regression models of mass dynamics, considering the linear, quadratic or logarithmic effects of the proportion of the diet that was grass (approximate to 1 - proportion of the diet that was browse) and the additive and interactive effects of nitrogen intake. Diet composition had strong effects on mass dynamics, and all models explained >= 73% of the variation (adjusted r(2)) in mass dynamics. Nitrogen intake had uniformly positive effects on mass balance, and increasing grass intake caused improved maintenance of body mass up to a point, but further increases in the proportion of grass in the diet had neutral or negative effects on body mass. Overall, the data suggest that elk are adapted to consuming mixed diets. Nonetheless, data on the foraging behavior and diet selection of wild elk in many populations show that elk often consume grass-dominated diets and sometimes consume browse-dominated diets, but rarely consume mixed diets. Physiological adaptations to mixed diets may place unique spatio-temporal constraints on diet selection in intermediate feeders and impose large penalties for a sub-optimal balance of grazing and browsing.},

	Abstract = {Decades of research have produced substantial data on elk (Cervus elapbus) diets in winter, when foraging conditions are most likely to affect population dynamics. Using data from 72 studies conducted in western North America between 1938 and 2002, we collated data on elk diets and environmental variables. We used these data to quantify diet selection by elk and to test whether variation in elk diets is associated with habitat type, winter severity, period of winter, human hunting, and study method. Graminoids (grasses and grass-like plants such as sedges) dominated elk diets and consistently occurred at a higher proportion in the diet than in elk foraging habitats, indicating preference. Forbs commonly made up <= 5% of the diet, with no evidence for preference; we conclude that forb use is largely incidental to grazing for graminoids. Browse was consumed in proportion to its availability, implying that the amount of browse in the diet was primarily determined by habitat use rather than selection. Comparing the diets of elk and sympatric ruminants, elk consistently selected graminoids more strongly than sympatric ruminants with the exception of bison (Bison bison), suggesting that elk are not environmentally forced to adopt the graminoid-biased diet that they normally select. The proportion of open meadows and grasslands on winter ranges was strongly and positively associated with graminoid consumption by elk. The proportion of graminoids in the diet was significantly lower in elk experiencing severe winter conditions or predation risk from human hunting. The period of winter (early, middle, and late) had only small effects on elk diets, as did the method by which the diet was determined. Overall, variation in elk diets is well-explained by a consistent tendency to select graminoids if available, modified by winter habitat type, predation risk, and winter severity, which can constrain habitat selection and access to grazing opportunities. To fully understand variation in foraging behavior, biologists should recognize these broad patterns when interpreting resource selection data. Managers should recognize that inconspicuous behavioral responses to environmental stimuli can alter the diet in ways that probably carry nutritional consequences.},

Given the ubiquity and strength of behavioral responses to predators by vertebrate prey, it is not safe to assume that risk effects on dynamics can be ignored.

	Abstract = {Recent increases in the height and growth ring width of willow (Salix spp.) and other woody plants in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) have been attributed to a behaviorally mediated trophic cascade from wolves (Canis lupus) to elk (Cervus elaphus) to willows. This hypothesis predicts that individual elk consume less willow in response to the presence of wolves, but this prediction has not been directly tested with data from elk. We collected 727 fecal samples from elk in the Gallatin Canyon portion of the GYE over three winters and used microhistological methods to quantify the proportion of willow in each sample. We then tested the effect of wolf presence on willow consumption by elk, controlling for the effects of snow conditions, sex, and habitat type. During the period of study, 8-17 wolves occupied the study area, and wolves were locally present on 49% of 260 sampling days, stratified at two-week intervals across three drainages. Over the three years combined, willow consumption was related to snow conditions, wolf presence, and a wolf 3 sex interaction. As expected, willow consumption increased with deeper and less penetrable snow, and this effect was strong. Contrary to expectation, willow consumption increased in the presence of wolves. As with other aspects of antipredator behavior, wolves had different effects on willow consumption by males and females. Finally, we aggregated the data to estimate winter-long mean willow consumption within each drainage; at this broader scale, willow consumption again increased as predation risk increased. In summary, willow consumption was more strongly affected by snow conditions than by the presence of wolves. Interactions between elk and willow were affected by wolves, but not as predicted by the hypothesis that wolf presence favors willow release through a reduction in the selection of willow by individual elk. If a trophic cascade is operating, our results suggest that a decline in the size of the elk population (to roughly one-half its size immediately prior to wolf recovery) may be more important than changes in the willow consumption of individual elk. Finally, reduced grazing of herbaceous vegetation may be equally important for vegetation dynamics.},

By constraining habitat selection, wolves may have greater effects oil elk dynamics than would be predicted oil the basis of direct predation alone. Based on changes in the woody vegetation following the reintroduction of wolves, it has been suggested that antipredator responses by elk may be driving a trophic cascade in the Yellowstone ecosystem. However, Studies to date have been hampered by a lack of direct data on spatial variation in predation risk, and the ways in which elk respond to variation in risk.

	Abstract = {A trophic cascade recently has been reported among wolves, elk, and aspen on the northern winter range of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA, but the mechanisms of indirect interactions within this food chain have yet to be established. We investigated whether the observed trophic cascade might have a behavioral basis by exploring environmental factors influencing the movements of 13 female elk equipped with GPS radio collars. We developed a simple statistical approach that can unveil the concurrent influence of several environmental features on animal movements. Paths of elk traveling on their winter range were broken clown into steps, which correspond to the straight-line segment between successive locations at 5-hour intervals. Each observed step was paired with 200 random steps having the same starting point, but differing in length and/or direction. Comparisons between the characteristics of observed and random steps using conditional logistic regression were used to model environmental features influencing movement patterns. We found that elk movements were influenced by multiple factors, such as the distance from roads, the presence of a steep slope along the step, and the cover type in which they ended. The influence of cover type on elk movements depended on the spatial distribution of wolves across the northern winter range of the park. In low wolf-use areas, the relative preference for end point locations of steps followed: aspen stands &GT; open areas &GT; conifer forests. As the risks of wolf encounter increased, the preference of elk f r aspen stands gradually decreased, and selection became strongest for steps ending in conifer forests in high wolf-use areas. Our study clarifies the behavioral mechanisms involved in the trophic cascade of Yellowstone's wolf-elk-aspen system: elk respond to wolves on their winter range by a shift in habitat selection, which leads to local reductions in the use of aspen by elk.},

To determine if a relationship exists between predation risk perceived by elk (Cervus elaphus) while browsing and elk position within the landscape, we observed a total of 56 female elk during two summers and 29 female elk during one winter. At a fine spatial (0-187 m) and temporal scale (145-300 s), results from our model selection indicated summer vigilance levels were greater for females with calves than for females without calves, with vigilance levels greater for all females at closer escape-impediment distances. Winter results also suggested greater female vigilance levels at closer escape-impediment distances, but further indicated an increase in vigilance levels with closer conifer-edge distances. Placed within the context of other studies, the results were consistent with a behaviorally mediated trophic cascade and provide a potential mechanism to explain the variability in observed woody plant release from browsing in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA.},

	Abstract = {Behaviorally mediated trophic cascades (BMTCs) occur when the fear of predation among herbivores enhances plant productivity. Based primarily on systems involving small-bodied predators, BMTCs have been proposed as both strong and ubiquitous in natural ecosystems. Recently, however, synthetic work has suggested that the existence of BMTCs may be mediated by predator hunting mode, whereby passive (sit-and-wait) predators have much stronger effects than active (coursing) predators. One BMTC that has been proposed for a wide-ranging active predator system involves the reintroduction of wolves (Canis lupus) to Yellowstone National Park, USA, which is thought to be leading to a recovery of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) by causing elk (Cervus elaphus) to avoid foraging in risky areas. Although this BMTC has been generally accepted and highly popularized, it has never been adequately tested. We assessed whether wolves influence aspen by obtaining detailed demographic data on aspen stands using tree rings and by monitoring browsing levels in experimental elk exclosures arrayed across a gradient of predation risk for three years. Our study demonstrates that the historical failure of aspen to regenerate varied widely among stands (last recruitment year ranged from 1892 to 1956), and our data do not indicate an abrupt cessation of recruitment. This pattern of recruitment failure appears more consistent with a gradual increase in elk numbers rather than a rapid behavioral shift in elk foraging following wolf extirpation. In addition, our estimates of relative survivorship of young browsable aspen indicate that aspen are not currently recovering in Yellowstone, even in the presence of a large wolf population. Finally, in an experimental test of the BMTC hypothesis we found that the impacts of elk browsing on aspen demography are not diminished in sites where elk are at higher risk of predation by wolves. These findings suggest the need to further evaluate how trophic cascades are mediated by predator-prey life history and ecological context.},

	Abstract = {The absence of an organism from a landscape for a long time can be a major barrier to the restoration of that species due to factors such as environmental conditions changing since extinction. This can make it difficult to assess the feasibility of reintroduction when an extirpated species cannot, by definition, be observed in the landscape of interest. In such situations, two important options for conservation scientists include: (1) to draw on insights from analogous ecosystems where the organism is extant, or where it has been successfully reintroduced and (2) to undertake research into the reintroduction in the location of interest under controlled experimental conditions. The idea of reintroducing wolves (Canis lupus) to the Scottish Highlands provides an excellent case study of such a situation. A key argument for reintroduction has been that native red deer (Cervus elaphus) numbers, considered by many to be ecologically unsustainable, would be reduced through wolf predation. To date, research into the ecological value of reintroduction has focused on this important issue. However, new research, emerging from wolf reintroduction projects in North America, suggests that nonlethal 'behaviourally-mediated' effects of wolves also have a profound effect on deer behaviour and consequently on the ecosystems in which they live. In short, deer avoid places or browse less where there is a high risk of wolf predation, which allows previously inhibited tree regeneration. The implications for wolf reintroduction in Scotland are that changes in deer behaviour could be as important as lethal effects, and that fewer wolves may be needed than indicated by predator-prey modelling to have significant positive impacts on ecosystems in the Scottish Highlands. Understanding the relative likely contributions of both lethal and nonlethal effects in the Scottish context will be challenging because nonlethal impacts result from an interaction between deer behaviour in response to wolf predation and particular landscapes and ecosystem features. While a full reintroduction may be far off, research must begin in the near term. There would be considerable scientific merit in establishing a large, controlled experiment (for example on an island or in a fenced area) in the Scottish Highlands to examine the relative lethal and nonlethal effects of wolves on deer and ecosystem restoration. In this paper, a long-term pathway for scientific research to provide sound ecological evidence to inform future decision-makers is proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Thirty-nine radiocarbon ages on beaver-pond deposits fall primarily within the last 4000 yr, but gaps in dated beaver Occupation front similar to 2200-1800 and 950-750 cal yr RP correspond with severe droughts that likely caused low to ephemeral discharges in smaller streams, as in modern severe drought.

	Abstract = {After an absence of approximately 70 years, gray wolves (Canis lupus) were re-introduced into Yellowstone National Park in the mid-1990s. We studied the potential influence of wolf/ungulate interactions upon willow (Salix spp.) growth in the valleys of the Gallatin and Lamar Rivers, as well as Slough and Soda Butte Creeks, in the northern Yellowstone ecosystem. When we compared willow heights from photographs taken prior to 1998 (willows < 2 m tall) with those taken in 2004, we found an increase in willow height for 22 of 42 sites within the study area. Based on comparisons of the chronosequence photos, since wolf introduction none of the 16 upland riparian sites showed an increase in willow height, while 22 of 26 of the valley-bottom riparian sites had willow height increases. In 2004, willow height exhibited a strong inverse relationship with the percentage of browsed stems (r = -0.81, p < 0.01, n = 42). Results of regressions for valley-bottom sites indicated that view distance, impediment distance, and the number of bison (Bison bison) flops were inversely related to willow height (p < 0.02). Increased willow heights were not significantly (p = 0.18) related to patterns of moisture availability. Willow height increases documented in this study appear to have been at least partially due to behaviorally mediated trophic cascades involving wolves and ungulates, via a mechanism of predation risk. While willow release (i.e., increased height growth) within the study area is in a very early stage, results suggest potentially important indirect effects of a top carnivore in a terrestrial food chain that may aid in the restoration of riparian species and the preservation of biodiversity.

	Abstract = {An inexpensive and reproducible method for monitoring rangelands over the northern range (NR) of Yellowstone National Park was developed utilizing Landsat imagery. A 1999 map of rangeland vegetation communities was created using boosted classification tree analysis. The 1999 map and a 1985 image were utilized in a change vector analysis resulting in a classified map for 1985. Classification accuracies ranged from 72.30 percent to 83.65 percent for the 1999 map and 72.60 percent to 88.73 percent for the 1985 map, depending upon level of class detail, demonstrating that Landsat-class data can be effectively used for efficient change analysis that maintains accuracy while reducing compound error. Spatial patterns of change were compared to theories from other studies related to change in the NR and were found to be consistent with effects from fire suppression, precipitation, and urban growth but not with trophic cascade from wolves or beaver effects.},

It is uncertain, however, how the effects of such interplay control ecosystem function. A 3- year experiment in grassland mesocosms revealed that actively hunting spiders reduced plant species diversity and enhanced aboveground net primary production and nitrogen mineralization rate, whereas sit- and- wait ambush spiders had opposite effects. These effects arise from the different responses to the two different predators by their grasshopper prey- the dominant herbivore species that controls plant species composition and accordingly ecosystem functioning. Predator hunting mode is thus a key functional trait that can help to explain variation in the nature of top- down control of ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {In the period following wolf (Canis lupus) reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park (1995-2004), the northern Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) herd declined from similar to 17000 to similar to 8000 elk (8.1% yr(-1)). The extent to which wolf predation contributed to this decline is not obvious because the influence of other factors (human harvest and lower than average annual rainfall) on elk dynamics has not been quantified. To assess the contribution of wolf predation to this elk decline, we built and assessed models based on elk-related data prior to wolf reintroduction (1961 to 1995). We then used the best of these models to predict how elk dynamics might have been realized after wolf reintroduction (1995 to 2004) had wolves never been reintroduced. The best performing model predicted 64% of the variance in growth rate and included elk abundance, harvest rate, annual snowfall, and annual precipitation as predictor variables. The best performing models also suggest that harvest may be super-additive. That is, for every one percent increase in harvest rate, elk population growth rate declines by more than one percent. Harvest rate also accounted for similar to 47% of the observed variation in elk growth rate. According to the best-performing model, which accounts for harvest rate and climate, the elk population would have been expected to decline by 7.9% per year, on average, between 1995 and 2004. Within the limits of uncertainty, which are not trivial, climate and harvest rate are justified explanations for most of the observed elk decline. To the extent that this is true, we suggest that between 1995 and 2004 wolf predation was primarily compensatory.},

	Abstract = {Effects of unmanaged populations of large mammalian herbivores, especially elk (Cervus elaphus) on vegetation is a concern in Yellowstone National Park, since wolves (Canis Lupus) are extirpated, ungulate migrations are altered by human activities and the disruption of natural process is possible. Stands of low, hedged (height-suppressed) willows (Salix spp.) are observed throughout the greater Yellowstone National Park area where high densities of wintering elk or moose (Alces alces) exist. The height of 47% of the willow stands surveyed on Yellowstone's northern winter range has been suppressed. Mean leader use of willows of all heights was 22% in the winter of 1987-88, increased to 60% in winter 1988-89, following the drought and fires of 1988, then declined to 44% in 1989-90 and winter 1990-96. Height-suppressed willows (43 $\pm$ 2 cm, x̄ $\pm$ SE) were about one-half as tall as tall willows (83 $\pm$ 4 cm). Percent twig use of suppressed willows in summer (25%) and winter (59%) was significantly more than for intermediate or tall stands (P<0.05). Suppressed willows produced about one-fourth the aboveground annual biomass compared to taller willows; even after 27 or 31 years of protection, previously-suppressed willows produced only one-third the aboveground biomass of taller willows, suggesting suppressed willows grow on sites with lower growth potential. Growth conditions for willows on the northern winter range may have declined due to a warmer and drier climate this century, locally reduced water tables-because of the decline on beaver (Castor canadenis), or fire suppression may be responsible for the observed changes. Tall and intermediate-height willows contained higher concentrations of nitrogen and they exhibited more water stress than height-suppressed willows of the same species. More xeric growth conditions this century than last century, especially during the decades of the 1920's, 1930's, and 1980's, may explain the low growth rates and lower chemical defenses against ungulate herbivory for height-suppressed willows. We propose a more xeric climate and locally-reduced water tables likely contributed to the willow declines on the northern winter range, but that the proximate factor in the declines was herbivory by native ungulates.},

On the Northern and Madison-Firehole ranges, elk diets varied over the 3 winters with lowest consumption of grasses (P ≤ 0.006) and highest consumption of conifers (P ≤ 0.044) during the first winter post-fire (1989), which was also the most severe winter with respect to snow depth. Sedge use by Northern range elk also varied (P ≤ 0.002) with lowest use during pre-fire winter 1988 and greatest use during winter 1990; sedge use was stable at the more thermally-influenced Madison-Firehole range. Decreasing (P ≤ 0.014) mean urinary potassium:creatinine (K:C) ratios reflected progressive nutritional restriction on all sampling areas during all 3 winters. Mean urinary urea nitrogen:creatinine (UN:C) ratios of elk varied (P < 0.001) on the lower, middle, and upper Northern range and at Madison-Firehole during all 3 winters, except on the lower Northern range during winter 1989. Values of mean UN:C ratios and temporal trends indicated nutritional restriction was greatest during winter 1989, and restriction was increasingly severe from the lower to upper elevations of the Northern range and most severe at Madison-Firehole, where snow depths were greatest. On the Northern and Madison-Firehole ranges, bison use of grasses decreased (P ≤ 0.006) and sedges increased (P ≤ 0.005), while conifer use remained low and stable throughout the study. In Pelican Valley, bison food habits were unaltered during the study. Bison and elk diets were more similar at Madison-Firehole than on the Northern range, suggesting greater competition for food at Madison-Firehole. Mean K:C ratios of bison declined (P ≤ 0.014) throughout all winters on all sampling areas. Mean UN:C ratios increased (P ≤ 0.030) on the Northern, Madison-Firehole, and Pelican Valley ranges in each winter. Mean UN:C ratios were lower in bison than in elk, but temporal trends indicated that nutritional restriction of bison progressively increased each winter and was most severe during winter 1989. Measured UN:C ratios and herd composition were used by the physiological model to predict DEI on each range for bison and elk. At the predicted DEI on each range, there were spatial and temporal differences in fat reserves and mortality rates of elk and bison. The physiological model predicted that Madison-Firehole elk and bison were more severely nutritionally restricted and had lower fat reserves during winter 1989 than elk and bison on the Northern range. Lower fat reserves and higher winter mortality rates of elk and bison calves compared to cows predicted by the physiological model were consistent with the differential pressure exerted by density-dependent factors and amplified during the more severe winter. The temporal and spatial dimensions of our physiological assessments and the variation of winter severity enabled us to demonstrate how the snow-urine/UN:C technique in combination with physiological modeling can be used to document the ecological context of the animals' physiological responses at the population level.},

	Abstract = {Abstract
Because some native ungulates have lived without top predators for generations, it has been uncertain whether runaway predation would occur when predators are newly restored to these systems. We show that landscape features and vegetation, which influence predator detection and capture of prey, shape large-scale patterns of predation in a newly restored predator--prey system. We analysed the spatial distribution of wolf (Canis lupus) predation on elk (Cervus elaphus) on the Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park over 10 consecutive winters. The influence of wolf distribution on kill sites diminished over the course of this study, a result that was likely caused by territorial constraints on wolf distribution. In contrast, landscape factors strongly influenced kill sites, creating distinct hunting grounds and prey refugia. Elk in this newly restored predator--prey system should be able to mediate their risk of predation by movement and habitat selection across a heterogeneous risk landscape.},

	Abstract = {{To ascertain whether browsing or hydrologic conditions influence the
   physiological performance of Salix and whether Salix and graminoids
   (Carex) use and possibly compete for similar water resources, we
   quantified the in situ seasonal patterns of plant water and carbon
   relations over three growing seasons. Our studies were designed to
   address the physiological factors which may be responsible for poor
   woody plant regeneration in montane riparian habitats of Rocky Mountain
   National Park, Cole. As these systems act to insure the delivery of
   fresh water to downstream users, the maintenance of their integrity is
   critical. We quantified plant water potentials, instantaneous rates of
   carbon fixation, leaf carbon isotope discrimination (Delta), leaf
   nitrogen content and water sources using stable isotopes of water
   (delta(18)O). The carbon and water relations of Salix were
   significantly affected by winter browsing by elk and in some cases by
   landscape position with regard to proximity to active streams. Winter
   browsing of Salix by elk significantly increased summer plant water
   potentials and integrative measures of gas exchange (Delta), though
   browsing did not consistently affect instantaneous rates of
   photosynthesis, leaf nitrogen or the sources of water used by Salix. No
   effect of experimental manipulations of surface water conditions on
   Salix physiology was observed, likely due to the mesic nature of our
   study period. Using a two-member linear mixing model, from delta(18)O
   values we calculated that Salix appears to rely on streams for
   approximately 80\% of its water. In contrast, the graminoid Carer
   derives almost 50\% of its water from rainfall, indicating divergent
   water source use by these two life forms. Based on these findings,
   winter browsing by elk improved Salix water balance possibly by
   altering the shoot to root ratio which in turn leads to higher water
   potentials and higher degrees of season-long gas exchange, while
   experimental damming had in general no effect on the physiological
   performance of Salix plants. In addition, as the water sources of Salix
   and Carex were significantly different, competition for water may not
   influence the growth, development, and regeneration of Salix. Thus,
   under the conditions of our study, herbivory had a positive effect on
   the physiological performance of Salix, but it is still unclear whether
   these changes in physiology transcend into improved Salix regeneration
   and survivorship. However, under drier environmental conditions such as
   lower snowpacks and lower stream flows, the browsing resistance of
   Salix and ecosystem regeneration may be greatly hindered because the
   reliance of Salix on stream water makes it vulnerable to changes in
   surface water and hydrological conditions.}},

By modeling the separate effects of density regulation, environmental stochasticity, and demographic stochasticity, we estimate the spatial scaling of the component that is due to environmental stochasticity in the population dynamics of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in Norway. The estimated spatial scaling of the environmental noise was similar to 200 km. An examination of how different weather variables influenced the scaling indicated that snow depth was the major weather variable affecting the scaling of synchrony in population fluctuations, and was negatively related to population growth rates in 97.4% of the 151 populations included in the study. A large-scale climatic phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation, was positively related to population growth rates in 94.7% of the populations but did not significantly affect the pattern of synchrony among populations. We used newly developed theoretical results of the contribution of environmental noise and dispersal to the spatial scale of synchrony to show that the spatial scaling estimated in this study could not be explained by dispersal. This suggests that common environmental noise operating mainly during the winter is able to synchronize population fluctuations of roe deer over large distances.},

Based on time series analyses of 26 Swiss ibex (Capra ibex) populations, we show that variation in winter climate affected the annual changes in population size of most of the populations after accounting for the effects of density dependence and demographic stochasticity. In addition, precipitation during early summer also influenced the population fluctuations. This suggests that the major influences of climate on ibex population dynamics operated either through loss of individuals during winter or early summer, or through an effect on fecundity. However, spatial covariation in these climate variables was not able to synchronize the population fluctuations of ibex over larger distances, probably due to large spatial heterogeneity in the effects of single climate variables on different populations. Such spatial variation in the influence of the same climate variable on the local population dynamics suggests that predictions of influences of climate change need to account for local differences in population dynamical responses to climatic conditions.},

	Abstract = {The evolving concept of ecosystem management is the focus of much current debate. To clarify discussion and provide a framework for implementation, I trace the historical development of ecosystem management, provide a working definition and summarize dominant themes taken from an extensive literature review. The general goal of maintaining ecological integrity is discussed along with five specific goals. maintaining viable populations, ecosystem representation, maintaining ecological process (i.e., natural disturbance regimes), protecting evolutionary potential of species and ecosystems, and accommodating human use in light of the above. Short-term policy implications of ecosystem management for several groups of key actors (scientists, policy makers, managers, citizens) are discussed Long-term ( gt 100 years) policy implications are also reviewed including reframing environmental values, fostering cooperation, and evaluating success. Ecosystem management is not just about science nor is it simply an extension of traditional resource management; it offers a fundamental reframing of how humans may work with nature.},

	Abstract = {1. Recent research reveals the widespread influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a large-scale climatic variation, on northern ungulate populations. Little is known, however, about the influence of the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO), a similar climatic index, on ungulates. 2. The influence of the NPO on elk population dynamics in Banff National Park (BNP) was examined using a 15-year time-series of three elk subpopulations exposed to different levels of predation by wolves. NPO was strongly related to local climate data including snow depth (r = +0¬∑61) and winter temperatures (r = -0¬∑51). 3. Higher NPO values reflected increasing winter severity, reducing elk population-growth rate irrespective of wolf-predation pressure. Elk population-growth rate, however, declined more strongly in areas with wolf predation through the interaction with winter severity, indexed by NPO. Effects of NPO were weaker in the absence of wolf predation. 4. Differences between the effects of snow and NPO were revealed that depended on wolf-predation pressure. Without wolf predation, NPO reduced elk population-growth rate, suggesting overall climate was important. With wolf predation, snow depth was more important than NPO, suggesting a mechanism of increased wolf-predation rates in deeper snow. 5. This study is the first to demonstrate the influential role of Pacific climate on western North American ungulate population dynamics and provides further evidence of the role of large-scale climatic variation in terrestrial ecosystem dynamics.},

	Abstract = {We examined how population density, winter weather, snow conditions, and 2 large-scale climatic indices (North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO, and Arctic Oscillation, AO) influenced demography (reproduction and mortality) in an alpine herd of semi-domesticated reindeer Rangifer tarandus between 1959 and 2000 in Finnish Lapland. The herd lived on heavily grazed lichen pastures, with winter densities between 0.8 and 3.9 individuals km−2. Icing conditions occurred every 7th yr, on an average, and decreased reproductive rate (calves/females) by 49%. In general linear models icing remarkably increased the fit of snow models to reproductive rate. Incorporation of an interaction term between icing and the snow depth index provided better fit than a model without interaction. Delayed snowmelt decreased reproductive rate. For the day of snowmelt, however, the model without interaction was better than the interaction model. These 3 models provided the best fit to the data and accounted for 51--54% of the variation in reproductive rate. Winter mortality was related to density and large-scale climatic indices, but not to local winter weather except a slight increase in mortality during an icing winter. The best model for winter mortality, including reindeer density and NAO, accounted for 26% of variation in mortality. Three factors may be involved explaining weak density dependence or the lack of such dependence; climate change scenarios that predict higher winter temperature, more frequent thawing-freezing periods, and deeper snow would be expected to decrease reproductive rate and increase winter mortality of reindeer and thus to reduce profitability of reindeer husbandry. In contrast, early springs would be advantageous for reindeer in the short term.},

	Abstract = {Weather is one of the most basic factors impacting animal populations, but the typical strength of such impacts on population dynamics is unknown. We incorporate weather and climate index data into analysis of 492 time series of mammals, birds and insects from the global population dynamics database. A conundrum is that a multitude of weather data may a priori be considered potentially important and hence present a risk of statistical over-fitting. We find that model selection or averaging alone could spuriously indicate that weather provides strong improvements to short-term population prediction accuracy. However, a block randomization test reveals that most improvements result from over-fitting. Weather and climate variables do, in general, improve predictions, but improvements were barely detectable despite the large number of datasets considered. Climate indices such as North Atlantic Oscillation are not better predictors of population change than local weather variables. Insect time series are typically less predictable than bird or mammal time series, although all taxonomic classes display low predictability. Our results are in line with the view that population dynamics is often too complex to allow resolving mechanisms from time series, but we argue that time series analysis can still be useful for estimating net environmental effects.},

	Abstract = {A problem in climate studies has been on how to treat causal chains of explanations and both direct and indirect effects. Mammals in strongly seasonal environments of the boreal forest typically lose condition during winter and gain mass (and reproduce) during the summer season when biomass and plant quality peak. Mass decay of large herbivores during winter is due to direct effects of winter weather, such as increased costs of movement, thermoregulation and reduced access to food when snow is deep. Deer condition during summer is thought to be affected mainly indirectly by weather through plants. High spring temperature speeds up plant development, and deep snow can delay phenology in early summer. Current statistical modelling does not take into account these mechanistic pathways. We used hierarchical Bayes modelling to more mechanistically link global climate, local weather and plant phenology to autumn body mass of red deer in Norway. Red deer were much more affected indirectly through trophic interactions. No solid evidence of direct effects of snow depth was found on autumn body mass. We discuss the implications of our results relative to our ability to predict effects of global change on large mammalian herbivores in the boreal forest.},

	Abstract = {1. Recently, contrasting evidence of density-dependent offspring sex ratio variation in red deer (Cervus elaphus L,) has been presented. Kruuk ct al. (1999) reported that the proportion of male red deer born on the island of Rum, Scotland, each year declined with increasing population density and with winter rainfall, i.e. as nutritional stress in females increased. In contrast, Post et al. (1999a) reported increasing male-biased offspring sex ratios in Hordaland, Norway, with both rising numbers of hinds and increasing values of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which they regarded an index of severe winters.2. Compared to Post ct al. (1999a), we reanalysed sex ratio variation on a greatly extended data set, including four populations of Norwegian red deer, taking into account a finer population substructure.3. The proportion of male calves shot each autumn declined markedly as density increased in all four populations. The proportion of male calves shot each autumn increased significantly with an increasing NAO index in one of the four populations, but there was no residual effect of the NAO once the effect of snow depth (at low elevation) was controlled for (decreasingly male biased harvest with increasing snow depth).4. At the west coast of Norway, the NAO is positively correlated with temperature and precipitation. However, since temperatures in this region often are around 0 degreesC during winter, the relationship between the NAO and snow depth may be difficult to predict,5. All analysis of variation in snow depth revealed that snow depth was negatively correlated with the NAO at low altitudes (below 400 m), but this relationship was reversed at high altitudes giving a positive correlation between snow depth and the NAG. We therefore suggest that a high NAO index indicates favourable winter conditions for red deer, as red deer winter at low altitude, and since recent studies show that a high index of the NAO is generally positively correlated with body weight in red deer. 6. Female red deer thus reared fewer sons as nutritional stress increased with increasing density and severity of climate in Norway, which is consistent with the birth sex ratios observed on Rum, Scotland.},

	Abstract = {The dynamics of animal populations can be influenced directly by prevailing resources, population density, and environmental conditions, and through the delayed effects of trophic interactions and, abiotic effects on habitat conditions. For large mammals, lagged effects can extend several years back in time. We attempted to establish the causal processes governing the population changes shown by I I ungulate species counted annually over a 20-year period in South Africa's Kruger National Park. Kudu, waterbuck, warthog, sable, tsessebe, roan, and eland declined progressively in abundance after 1986, while zebra, wildebeest, impala, and giraffe maintained high abundance levels. To identify lagged influences, we used statistical probes indexing (1) inferred changes in predator abundance as a consequence of past food availability, (2) effects on habitat conditions of prior rainfall, and (3) competitor impacts on shared food resources. Multiple linear regression models were fit to estimates of annual population growth derived from the count totals subdivided among four regions. The temporal pattern of the population declines by five species was most consistent with a lagged effect from past predator food, in addition to the direct effects of seasonal rainfall. However, models including the lagged effect of prior rainfall fit nearly as well. Species that maintained high abundance responded mainly to an immediate or lagged density feedback. Changing rainfall conditions apparently affect the relative susceptibility of ungulate species to predation. Hence, the top-down interaction with predators cannot readily be disentangled from extrinsic influences on population dynamics, mediated through resources. Population declines by some species became extreme because a prolonged period of low rainfall, especially in the dry-season component, followed a doubling in the food base supporting lions, and was coupled with widened prey distribution as a consequence of the augmentation of water points by managers. Changes. in population abundance within this multi-prey, generalist predator system arose from a complex interplay between changing climatic conditions, variable food production, shifting habitat conditions, varying vulnerability to predation, and spillover effects on other species.},

	Abstract = {Spatial gradients in density dependence and cyclieity are familiar features of the population dynamics of small mammals, particularly Fennoscandian rodents. The most well-documented of such gradients is a weakening of direct density dependence and an increase in the tendency of populations to cycle the farther north they occur, a phenomenon that has been attributed to gradients in predation and seasonality. Among large mammals, however, for which evidence of cyclicity is less clear, geographic gradients in population dynamics are limited to spatial variation in the strength of density independence. The population dynamics of caribou and muskoxen in Greenland, for example, display latitudinal gradients in the response of populations to large-scale climatic fluctuation. To my knowledge, the existence of spatial gradients in density dependence has not been explicitly investigated in large mammals. Here I present an analysis of the dynamics of 27 populations of caribou and reindeer in Greenland, Finland, and Russia, spanning 21 degrees of latitude (51.7 degrees-72.7 degrees N) and 215 degrees of longitude (56.4 degrees W-159.5 degrees E), to identify spatial gradients in density dependence and independence. Results of autoregressive time series analysis show a clear gradient in the strength of direct density dependence exhibited by these populations that declines from southern to northern latitudes. Although this pattern mirrors the latitudinal gradient evident in Fennoscandian rodent dynamics, an analysis of the dimensionality of these time series suggests that few, if any, of the populations are limited by predators. The existence of an inverse latitudinal gradient in the magnitude of the influence of large-scale climate on the dynamics of these populations suggests there may be a tension in the strength of density-dependent vs. density-independent limitation experienced by them.},

	Abstract = {Models of climate change predict that global temperatures and precipitation will increase within the next century, with the most pronounced changes occurring in northern latitudes and during winter. A large-scale atmospheric phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), is a strong determinant of both interannual variation and decadal trends in temperatures and precipitation during winter in northern latitudes, and its recent persistence in one extreme phase may be a substantial component of increases in global temperatures. Hence, we investigated the influences of large-scale climatic variability on plant phenology and ungulate population ecology by incorporating the NAO in statistical analyses of previously published data on: (1) the timing of flowering by plants in Norway, and (2) phenotypic and demographic variation in populations of northern ungulates. We analyzed 137 time series on plant phenology for 13 species of plants in Norway spanning up to 50 yr (44 +/- 0.5 yr, mean +/- 1 se) and 39 time series on phenotypic and demographic traits of 7 species of northern ungulates from 16 populations in North America and northern Europe spanning up to 30 yr(18 +/- 2.0 yr). Plant phenology was significantly related to the NAO in 97 time series (71% of the total), in which dynamics of the NAO explained, on average, between 9% and 28% of the interannual variation in flowering dates. Following increasingly warm, wet winters, most plant species (9 of 13 species) bloomed earlier by an average of 13.0 +/- 0.8 d to 26.4 +/- 1.8 d. (mean +/- 1 se), one-third (4 of 11 species) bloomed longer by 13.4 +/- 1.1 d to 18.8 +/- 1.7 d, and there was an increase in spatial variability in timing of flowering across landscapes by five of six species. Woody plants displayed less sensitivity to climatic variability than did herbaceous species, and early-blooming plants were more strongly influenced by the NAO than were late-blooming plants. Ungulate phenotypic and demographic variables were significantly related to the NAO in 28 time series (72% of the total). Large-scale climatic variability influenced growth, development, fecundity, and demographic trends of all seven species of ungulates studied, and in some populations, the NAO acted together with density dependence. Individuals within mainland populations responded to winter warming with reduced body size and increased fecundity, whereas winter warming in maritime regions led to increased body size but reduced fecundity. Across sex and age classes, between 43% and 70% of the observed range in body mass among years was attributable to the dynamics of the NAG, and within cohorts of female red deer and reindeer, 47-70% of the observed range in fecundity was related to the NAO during the winter preceding cohort birth years. All but two populations of northern ungulates declined following increasingly warmer winters, and the NAO operated, in most instances, in concert with direct density dependence to limit populations. In comparison to the original analyses of these ungulate time series, in 10 of 19 series the NAO explained an equal or greater percentage of variation than that explained by local weather. These observations indicate that large-scale climatic variability has a detectable influence on the ecology of plants and animals in a variety of terrestrial ecosystems, and that the responses of plants to winter warming may, surprisingly, be more subtle than the responses of large herbivores.},

	Abstract = {The theory of regulation in animal populations is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of populations, the causes of mortality and how natural selection shapes the life history of species. In mammals, the great range in body size allows us to see how allometric relationships affect the mode of regulation. Resource limitation is the fundamental cause of regulation. Top-down limitation through predators is determined by four factors: (i) body size; (ii) the diversity of predators and prey in the system; (iii) whether prey are resident or migratory; and (iv) the presence of alternative prey for predators. Body size in mammals has two important consequences. First, mammals, particularly large species, can act as keystones that determine the diversity of an ecosystem. I show how keystone processes can, in principle, be measured using the example of the wildebeest in the Serengeti ecosystem. Second, mammals act as ecological landscapers by altering vegetation succession. Mammals alter physical structure, ecological function and species diversity in most terrestrial biomes. In general, there is a close interaction between allometry, population regulation, life history and ecosystem dynamics. These relationships are relevant to applied aspects of conservation and pest management.},

	Abstract = {The Hardangervidda wild reindeer herd in Norway is the largest in Western Europe. It was fluctuated between 7000 and 32,000 animals during the last 35 years. Four density-dependent effects were found: 1. A food limitation effect due to a shift in diet after overgrazing lichen on the winter range. This led to increased tooth wear and lowered body size and fat reserves. 2. A significant correlation between population density and juvenile winter survival rate. No effect on adult female survival rate was found. 3. A cohort effect. After population increase and overgrazing, recruitment was reduced by 30% and remained so after population reduction. Birth weights had increased by 30% 5 years after population reductin and the mean calving time was earlier. As a result, after population reduction weights of newborns were 40% greater at a comparable date. Neonatal survival rate was related to maternal condition during the last part of gestation which coincides with the peak winter snow accumulation. The slow increase in adult dressed body weights (DBW) after population reduction is due to the combined effects of increased tooth wear when winter range was limiting and to the cohort-generation time, so that an improvement in neonatal survival and size was first expressed in subsequent offspring cohorts. 4. An inter-generation effect. During 30 years of resource limitation, DBW decreased by 23%, birth rate was unchanged after the first peak, while fecundity increased by 15%, suggesting increased reproductive effort per unit body weight. Natural selection for increased reproductive effort by smaller female when food was limiting was suggested. Some size-effect due to hunters selecting the largest adult phenotypes was possible but not the main cause. These results do not support some earlier hypotheses about the effects of population density on size at maturity in ungulates.},

	Abstract = {Nonlinear and irregular population dynamics may arise as a result of phase dependence and coexistence of multiple attractors. Here we explore effects of climate and density in the dynamics of a highly fluctuating population of wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) on Svalbard observed over a period of 29 years. Time series analyses revealed that density dependence and the effects of local climate (measured as the degree of ablation [melting] of snow during winter) on numbers were both highly nonlinear: direct negative density dependence was found when the population was growing (R-t > 0 ) and during phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) characterized by winters with generally high (1979-1995) and low (1996-2007) indices, respectively. A growth-phase-dependent model explained the dynamics of the population best and revealed the influence of density-independent processes on numbers that a linear autoregressive model missed altogether. In particular, the abundance of reindeer was enhanced by ablation during phases of growth (R-t > 0), an observation that contrasts with the view that periods of mild weather in winter are normally deleterious for reindeer owing to icing of the snowpack. Analyses of vital rates corroborated the nonlinearity described in the population time series and showed that both starvation mortality in winter and fecundity were nonlinearly related to fluctuations in density and the level of ablation. The erratic pattern of growth of the population of reindeer in Adventdalen seems, therefore, to result from a combination of the effects of nonlinear density dependence, strong density-dependent mortality, and variable density independence related to ablation in winter.},

	Abstract = {Variation in the abundance of animals has traditionally been explained as the outcome of endogenous forcing from density dependence and exogenous forcing arising from variation in weather and predation. Emerging evidence suggests that the effects of density dependence interact with external influences on population dynamics. In particular, spatial heterogeneity in resources and the presence of capable predators may weaken feedbacks from density dependence to growth of populations. We used the Kalman filter to analyze 23 time series of estimates of abundance of northern ungulate populations arrayed along a latitudinal gradient (latitude range of 40A degrees-70A degrees N) to evaluate the influence of spatial heterogeneity in resources and predation on density dependence. We also used contingency tables to test whether density dependence was independent of the presence of carnivores (our estimate of predation) and multiple regressions to determine the effects of spatial heterogeneity in resources, predation, and latitude on the strength of density dependence. Our results showed that the strength of density dependence of ungulate populations was low in the presence of large carnivores, particularly at northern latitudes with low primary productivity. We found that heterogeneity in elevation, which we assume acted as a surrogate for spatial heterogeneity in plant phenology, also reduced effects of density dependence. Thus, we show that external forces created by heterogeneity in resources and predation interact with internal feedbacks from population density to shape dynamics of populations of northern ungulates.},

	Abstract = {There is increasing evidence that the globe is currently warming, with changes being more pronounced in northern latitudes. Understanding the ecological effects of climatic variability is therefore important. There is recent support for the idea that a large-scale atmospheric phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), through its effects on vegetation and regional weather conditions, influences several aspects of life histories and population dynamic processes of several mammal species, including reindeer Rangifer tarandus. However, patterns are inconsistent both between species and within species. Here, we focus on reindeer, a herbivore that inhabits an extremely seasonal environment. We review and discuss predicted patterns of global climatic change in Norway and assess potential consequences for reindeer husbandry. We argue that although it is clearly shown that local and global climate affect reindeer directly (e.g. increased energetic costs of moving through deep snow and in accessing forage through snow) and indirectly (e.g. effect on forage plant biomass and quality, level of insect harassment and associated parasitism), it is difficult to predict a general pattern of how future climate change will influence this species. It is especially difficult to predict how reindeer husbandry (an important economic and cultural activity for the Saami People) will be affected in Norway. Indeed, (1) patterns in life history traits and Population parameters of reindeer vary over space and time, (2) both temperature and precipitation will increase in Norway, with greater changes in the North, i.e. the areas with reindeer husbandry, but the rate of increase will vary with space and seasons, (3) there are several indirect effects of global warming that can complicate the ecological response, especially involving the response of vegetation (e.g. forage on which reindeer depend), and (4) spatial variation, seasonality, complexity of the ecosystem functioning and nonlinearity of ecological processes make any firm prediction uncertain. Consequently, it is difficult to assess the practical and socio-economic implications for the reindeer husbandry industry.},

	Abstract = {The Swedish carnivore policy goal for the four large carnivores - wolverine (Gulo gulo), wolf (Canis lupus), brown bear (Ursus arctos) and lynx (Lynx lynx) - is to ensure a minimum viable population on a long-term basis. To reach this goal the policy restricts population regulation activities, like hunting (prohibited for wolverine and wolf and restricted for brown bear and lynx) in Sweden. For owners of semi-domesticated (i.e. reindeer), and domesticated (livestock) animals this policy and the existence of individuals of these four species results in externalities associated with predation. This paper presents econometric estimates of the predation and the social costs for these four species, based on ecological models of functional response. The data on costs is based on compensation provided to livestock owners by the Swedish government. The paper also applies these econometric estimates to predict the social cost per species when the population goals of the Swedish carnivore policy are reached. Based on out our model the wolverine and the lynx will impose the highest marginal, as well as total costs on society, given the current policy goals. The wolf is an efficient predator, but due to its geographical distribution in Sweden, its social costs are less than anticipated. The brown bear is largely omnivorous, thus resulting in relatively low social costs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The relative influences of density-dependent and -independent processes on vital rates and population dynamics have been debated in ecology for over half a century, yet it is only recently that both processes have been shown to operate within the same population. However, generalizations on the role of each process across species are rare. Using a process- orientated generalized linear modelling approach we show that variations in fecundity rates in populations of three species of ungulates with contrasting life histories are associated with density and winter weather in a remarkably similar manner. However, there are differences and we speculate that they are a result of differences in size between the species. Much previous research exploring the association between vital rates, population dynamics and density-dependent and - independent processes has used pattern-orientated approaches to decompose time-series into contributions from density-dependent and -independent processes. Results from these analyses are sometimes used to infer associations between vital rates, density and climatic variables. We compare results from pattern-orientated analyses of time-series with process- orientated analyses and report that the two approaches give different results. The approach of analysing relationships between vital rates, density and climatic variables may detect important processes influencing population dynamics that time- series methodologies may overlook.},

Rather than resulting from flawed or fraudulent science, we suggest that conflicting findings may often result front the complex nature of environmental systems and the limitations of our analytical tools. Using heuristic simulation examples, we shou, how environmental heterogeneity and limitations in our ability to measure and model environmental systems can give rise to conflicting inferences even for very simple systems. Although analytical tools are improving, individual studies will remain limited in their ability to describe complex environmental systems. We suggest that, instead of being a curse, multiple studies with conflicting findings often provide an opportunity to expand and refine our understanding of complex environmental systems. Using hierarchical Bayesian techniques, we show how pooling multiple studies can enable us to generate a broader, richer, and more accurate understanding of the dynamics of a system and to better estimate our uncertainties.},

	Abstract = {Estimates of uncertainty are the basis for inference of population risk. Uncertainty is estimated from models fitted to data that typically include a deterministic model (e.g., population growth) and stochastic elements, which should accommodate errors in sampling and any sources of variability that affect observations. Prediction from fitted models (of, say, demography) to new variables (say, population growth) requires propagation of these stochastic elements. Ecological models ignore most forms of variability, because they make statistical models complex, and they pose computational challenges. Variability associated with space, time, and among individuals that is not accommodated by demographic models can make parameter estimates and growth rate predictions unrealistic. I adapt a hierarchical approach to the problem of estimating population growth rates and their uncertainties when individuals vary and that variability cannot be assigned to specific causes. In contrast to an overfitted model that would assign a different parameter value to each individual, hierarchical models accommodate individual differences, but assume that those differences derive from an underlying distribution-they belong to a "population." The hierarchical model can be implemented in classical (frequentist) and Bayesian frameworks (I demonstrate both) and analyzed using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Results show that population growth models that rely on standard propagation of estimation error but ignore variability among individuals can misrepresent uncertainties in ways that erode credibility.},

@article{Polis:1998_lizzards,
	Abstract = {Spider density on desert islands in the Gulf of California is a joint function of variable productivity (bottom-up effects) and consumer intensity (top-down effects). Data from 20 islands and five years (1990-1994) show that the cumulative productivity of islands, a sum of the input of marine detritus and terrestrial plant productivity, varies spatially and temporally. Marine inputs are a function of the perimeter/area ratio and are thus relatively greater on smaller islands. Land plant productivity, a function of precipitation, is negligible in most years but can increase greatly (10-160X in plant cover) with heavy rains from El Nino events (e.g., 1992-1993). Consumer intensity is a function of the continual influence of predaceous scorpions and the sporadic occurrence of parasitoid spider wasps (Pompilidae); the importance of these factors varies greatly, both because scorpions are absent on some islands and because parasitoid densities show extreme year-to-year oscillations. El Nino rains produced large changes in the quantity and quality of plant resources and the control of spider populations. Spider densities doubled in 1992 in response to high levels of prey that followed heavy rains but crashed in 1993, despite continued high plant productivity and prey availability. The appearance of copious nectar and pollen, food of adult parasitoid wasps, caused wasp populations to erupt in 1993. Wasps emerged as a major, but previously hidden, trophic influence and greatly suppressed spider populations. Pompilids act as nonequilibrium agents-they are regulated by factors other than prey (spider) availability. In general, smaller spider populations were more variable year to year in the magnitude of their increases and decreases. In spite of the great temporal and spatial variability, consistent changes in plant, prey, spider, and wasp dynamics occurred repeatedly and apparently independently on islands throughout the archipelago. Such patterns of concerted change strongly suggest that general processes related to productivity and consumption are key to understanding the dynamics of this system.},

@article{ISI:000081368500022,
	Abstract = {{Models of climate change predict that global temperatures and
   precipitation will increase within the next century, with the most
   pronounced changes occurring in northern latitudes and during winter. A
   large-scale atmospheric phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation
   (NAO), is a strong determinant of both interannual variation and
   decadal trends in temperatures and precipitation during winter in
   northern latitudes, and its recent persistence in one extreme phase may
   be a substantial component of increases in global temperatures. Hence,
   we investigated the influences of large-scale climatic variability on
   plant phenology and ungulate population ecology by incorporating the
   NAO in statistical analyses of previously published data on: (1) the
   timing of flowering by plants in Norway, and (2) phenotypic and
   demographic variation in populations of northern ungulates. We analyzed
   137 time series on plant phenology for 13 species of plants in Norway
   spanning up to 50 yr (44 +/- 0.5 yr, mean +/- 1 se) and 39 time series
   on phenotypic and demographic traits of 7 species of northern ungulates
   from 16 populations in North America and northern Europe spanning up to
   30 yr(18 +/- 2.0 yr).
   Plant phenology was significantly related to the NAO in 97 time series
   (71\% of the total), in which dynamics of the NAO explained, on
   average, between 9\% and 28\% of the interannual variation in flowering
   dates. Following increasingly warm, wet winters, most plant species (9
   of 13 species) bloomed earlier by an average of 13.0 +/- 0.8 d to 26.4
   +/- 1.8 d. (mean +/- 1 se), one-third (4 of 11 species) bloomed longer
   by 13.4 +/- 1.1 d to 18.8 +/- 1.7 d, and there was an increase in
   spatial variability in timing of flowering across landscapes by five of
   six species. Woody plants displayed less sensitivity to climatic
   variability than did herbaceous species, and early-blooming plants were
   more strongly influenced by the NAO than were late-blooming plants.
   Ungulate phenotypic and demographic variables were significantly
   related to the NAO in 28 time series (72\% of the total). Large-scale
   climatic variability influenced growth, development, fecundity, and
   demographic trends of all seven species of ungulates studied, and in
   some populations, the NAO acted together with density dependence.
   Individuals within mainland populations responded to winter warming
   with reduced body size and increased fecundity, whereas winter warming
   in maritime regions led to increased body size but reduced fecundity.
   Across sex and age classes, between 43\% and 70\% of the observed range
   in body mass among years was attributable to the dynamics of the NAG,
   and within cohorts of female red deer and reindeer, 47-70\% of the
   observed range in fecundity was related to the NAO during the winter
   preceding cohort birth years. All but two populations of northern
   ungulates declined following increasingly warmer winters, and the NAO
   operated, in most instances, in concert with direct density dependence
   to limit populations. In comparison to the original analyses of these
   ungulate time series, in 10 of 19 series the NAO explained an equal or
   greater percentage of variation than that explained by local weather.
   These observations indicate that large-scale climatic variability has a
   detectable influence on the ecology of plants and animals in a variety
   of terrestrial ecosystems, and that the responses of plants to winter
   warming may, surprisingly, be more subtle than the responses of large
   herbivores.}},

	Abstract = {{Reindeer/caribou (Rangifer tarandus), which constitute a biological
   resource of vital importance for the physical and cultural survival of
   Arctic residents, and inhabit extremely seasonal environments, have
   received little attention in the global change debate. We investigated
   how body weight and growth rate of reindeer calves were affected by
   large-scale climatic variability {[}measured by the North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO) winter index] and density in one population in
   central Norway. Body weights of calves in summer and early winter, as
   well as their growth rate (summer to early winter), were significantly
   influenced by density and the NAO index when cohorts were in utero.
   Males were heavier and had higher absolute growth than females, but
   there was no evidence that preweaning condition of male and female
   calves were influenced differently by the NAO winter index. Increasing
   NAO index had a negative effect on calves' body weight and growth rate.
   Increasing density significantly reduced body weight and growth rate of
   calves, and accentuated the effect of the NAO winter index. Winters
   with a higher NAO index are thus severe for reindeer calves in this
   area and their effects are associated with nutritional stress
   experienced by the dams during pregnancy or immediately after calving.
   Moreover, increased density may enhance intra-specific competition and
   limits food available at the individual level within cohorts. We
   conclude that if the current pattern of global warming continues, with
   greater change occurring in northern latitudes and during winter as is
   predicted, reduced body weight of reindeer calves may be a consequence
   in areas where winters with a high NAO index are severe. This will
   likely have an effect on the livelihood of many northern indigenous
   peoples, both economically and culturally.}},

	Abstract = {Seasonal changes in crude protein content of graminoids and herbs grazed by red deer were monitored from 1 May, or as soon as snow melt exposed the vegetation, until 15 October at five sites along an altitudinal gradient from coast to inland. Crude protein declined exponentially with time at all sites, but declined most rapidly from initially higher values at inland locations at high elevations. As a result crude protein was positively correlated with altitude and distance from the coast in early summer and negatively correlated in autumn. The relationships between protein content, date and altitude were used to estimate the quality of the diet of twelve radio-collared female red deer that migrated to summer ranges in the mountains. Individual differences in body weight were significantly related to the estimated, mean crude protein in vegetation available during the summer. Constraints on the timing of migration to exploit the maximal protein concentrations at higher altitudes and the fitness benefits of adaptive ranging behaviour are discussed.},
