This dictionary is made from OOo-Thesaurus_2-050720.zip that can be found
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/openoffice-es/. The original archive was
distributed under the LGPL license. I only repacked the .zip archive to
.tar.bz2, renamed the files to use the usual suffix _v2 instead of _new,
and added this README.


Yours sincerely,
