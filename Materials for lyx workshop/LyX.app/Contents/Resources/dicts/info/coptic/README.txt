These are the dict and affix files needed for
spell checking of Coptic in Bohairic dialect
with hunspell (and OpenOffice.org).

Starting from version 0.3 an experimental and very simple
hyphenation is added.

The corpus is still very small, and the dictionary
is rather in an experimental status. Right now, all
words of the Coptic liturgies and the New Testament
are included. Also many Greek words that were adapted
in Bohairic are included, but as rigid words (with no
affix rules).
In future, newer versions should be available at
