Comment of the extension owner
==============================

* A dedicated Latin hyphenation modul is not available, but an Italian hyphenation modul can do that too. Therefore "hyph_it_IT.dic" was renamed "hyph_la.dic", allowing to use Latin dictionary as a standalone spell checker having its own hyphenation.

* The Latin spelling dictionary 2.0 has been basically revised. For detailed information read the readme files. Your comment is wellcome.

* An extension update is intended to be published, as soon the dictionary will have been actualized.
